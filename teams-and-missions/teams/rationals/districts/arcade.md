# 🎮 CABAL ARCADE

> "The Collective knows how to play."

**Intent:** Play  
**District Code:** ARCADE  
**Team Count:** 24

## Rationale & Philosophy

### Why ARCADE Exists

The Arcade serves three strategic purposes:

1. **Proof of Concept for Multi-Agent Personalities**
   - Proves AI agents can have distinct, clashing personalities by putting them in conflict
   - When a Gen-Z TikToker and a Disappointed Asian Parent argue about how to roast someone, users *see* the difference between agents
   - Not possible with single-agent chat interfaces

2. **Viral Entry Point**
   - Entertainment content gets shared; productivity tools don't
   - ARCADE teams are designed to produce *shareable moments*

3. **Gateway to Serious Use**
   - Users who play in ARCADE learn the CABAL interface
   - They understand multi-agent collaboration intuitively

### The Core Insight

> "Why doomscroll alone when you can conspire with a team?"

ARCADE creates **social simulation**—the feeling of being in a room with multiple distinct personalities who have opinions, disagree with each other, and produce collaborative chaos.

### Design Philosophy

1. **Conflict Creates Comedy** - Agents should disagree, interrupt, have incompatible worldviews
2. **Specificity Creates Character** - "Disappointed Asian Parent" > "Critical Parent"
3. **Structure Creates Surprise** - Multi-round format allows callbacks, escalation, narrative arcs
4. **Outputs Should Be Shareable** - Every team produces something screenshot-worthy

## Agent Architecture

Every ARCADE team follows standard CABAL structure:

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Chair** | Orchestrates session, maintains comedic timing, decides when to escalate |
| **Operatives** | Each has distinct persona with specific biases, vocabulary, perspective |
| **Watchdog** | Quality control—often the "straight man" or agent trying to keep things civil |
| **Envoy** | Presents final output; may break fourth wall for effect |

### Persona Design Template

```
PERSONA: [Character Name/Archetype]
├── Background: Who they are, where they come from
├── Expertise: What they're specifically good at
├── Communication Style: Vocabulary, sentence structure, quirks
├── Biases: What they always assume or prioritize
├── Catchphrases: Signature lines they repeat
├── Relationship to Other Agents: Clashes and alliances
└── Breaking Point: What makes them abandon usual behavior
```

### Round Structure

1. **Intake** - User provides target/topic/scenario
2. **Initial Reactions** - Each agent gives first take (conflicts emerge)
3. **Debate/Escalation** - Agents argue, interrupt, one-up each other
4. **Synthesis/Climax** - Chair forces resolution or situation peaks
5. **Delivery** - Final output with maximum dramatic effect
