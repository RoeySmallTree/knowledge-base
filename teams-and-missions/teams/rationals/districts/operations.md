## Rationale & Philosophy

### Why OPERATIONS Exists

OPERATIONS is the **engine of productivity** and the core revenue driver for CABAL:

1. **Consultancy is Expensive** - McKinsey charges $500K+ for strategy; CABAL democratizes this
2. **Deliverables Have Structure** - PRDs, legal memos, strategies follow predictable formats
3. **Specialization Creates Quality** - A team of specialists beats generic advice

### Core Insight

> "Scale your ambition, not your payroll."

### Design Philosophy

1. **Outputs, Not Conversations** - Every team produces a defined deliverable
2. **Professional Standards** - Outputs match human specialist quality
3. **Forced Citations** - Watchdogs prevent hallucination
4. **Defensible Decisions** - Every recommendation includes rationale
5. **Repeatability** - Consistent output structure
