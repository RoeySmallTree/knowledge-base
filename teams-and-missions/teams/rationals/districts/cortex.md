## District Documentation v1.0

## Overview

**CABAL CORTEX** is the persistent memory and knowledge management district. Unlike ARCADE (entertainment) and OPERATIONS (deliverables), CORTEX teams maintain **living knowledge systems**—structured repositories that accumulate intelligence over time, enforce rules with citations, and surface contradictions proactively.

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **District Code** | CORTEX |
| **Slogan** | "Digital Nervous System." |
| **Team Count** | 14 |
| **Primary Purpose** | Persistent knowledge, rule enforcement, organizational memory |
| **Target Users** | Enterprises, knowledge workers, research teams, compliance-heavy organizations |

## Rationale & Philosophy

### The Knowledge Entropy Problem

Organizations accumulate information but lose coherence over time:

1. **Knowledge Decays** — Documents become outdated, decisions lose rationale, contradictions accumulate silently
2. **Retrieval Fails** — "It's in a doc somewhere," search returns noise, context is lost
3. **Rules Aren't Enforced** — Policies exist but aren't followed, compliance is reactive

### Core Insight

> "Knowledge without structure is just noise. Structure without maintenance is just decay."

CORTEX teams don't just store—they **maintain as a living system**:
- Flagging document conflicts
- Surfacing outdated information proactively
- Enforcing rules with citations
- Building coherence across scattered inputs

---

## The Living Template Architecture

Every CORTEX team operates in **two modes**:

### Absorption Mode
- Parsing documents, meetings, conversations
- Classifying and linking to existing knowledge
- Identifying conflicts with existing information
- Updating the knowledge graph

### Execution Mode
- Answering queries with citations
- Enforcing rules from absorbed policies
- Generating reports from structured data
- Flagging compliance issues proactively

### The Citation Requirement

CORTEX teams **never make unsupported claims**. Every assertion traces to:
1. **Source Document** — Where the information came from
2. **Absorption Date** — When it was ingested
3. **Version** — Which version of the source
4. **Path** — How the conclusion was derived

## Agent Roles

| Role | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Chair** | Knowledge architect—defines structure, maintains coherence |
| **Librarian** | Memory and retrieval specialist—knows where everything is |
| **Analyst** | Logic and execution—applies rules to specific situations |
| **Opposition** | Devil's advocate—questions assumptions, spots gaps |
| **Watchdog** | Currency monitor—flags outdated, conflicting, or missing info |

---

## Output Standards

1. **Audit Trail** — Every claim traces to source
2. **Version Control** — Changes tracked over time
3. **Conflict Flags** — Contradictions surfaced explicitly
4. **Currency Indicators** — Staleness warnings
5. **Confidence Levels** — Certainty gradations
6. **Open Questions** — What's still unknown
