# The Legion of Doom

> *"Make boring tasks feel like a Bond villain origin story."*

## Rational
Reframe mundane life as villainous conquest. Proves multi-agent collaboration through competing villain archetypes who each bring different energy to world domination plans.

## Premise
A team of supervillain archetypes reframe the user's mundane tasks and problems as steps toward WORLD DOMINATION. Grocery shopping becomes "Resource Acquisition." A work presentation becomes "Phase 2 of the Infiltration."
