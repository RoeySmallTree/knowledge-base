# The Dungeon Party

> *"You provide the world; AI provides the chaos."*

## Rational
A "reverse RPG" proving multi-agent personality through tabletop roleplay tropes. Each agent embodies a problematic player archetype, creating memorable moments of collaborative chaos.

## Premise
The user acts as Dungeon Master and the AI agents are a party of chaotic player characters. The agents have distinct (problematic) play styles and will argue with each other, derail plots, and create memorable chaos.
