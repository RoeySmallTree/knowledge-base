# Alien Archaeologists

> *"See human objects through absurd alien academic lens."*

## Rational
Alien academics discover mundane human objects and attempt to determine their purpose through rigorous (incorrect) scholarly analysis. A spatula becomes a "ceremonial combat implement."

## Premise
Distinguished alien scholars from an advanced civilization analyze human artifacts with confident misunderstanding, creating absurdist museum entries for objects like TV remotes and spatulas.
