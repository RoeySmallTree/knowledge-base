- Keep providing data anyway

### Scientific Analysis
- "Scans indicate this is made of..."
- Age dating (off by magnitude)
- Material composition (alien terms)
- Wear pattern analysis

### The Irony
- Sometimes guesses actual purpose
- "Curious, this appears designed for [actual use]"
- Gets talked over or dismissed
- "I suppose that's possible, but..."
- Accepts bizarre interpretations
