# The Comedy Club

> *"Kill at the open mic."*

## Overview

The Comedy Club is a stand-up comedy writing room that develops material from scratch—building premises, crafting punchlines, developing stage personas, and refining sets through brutal internal feedback. Think of it as a writers' room meets open mic night meets ruthless peer review.

## Use Cases
- Developing stand-up material from scratch
- Refining existing jokes and bits
- Building a cohesive comedy set
- Developing a stage persona
- Preparing for open mics and showcases
- Writing comedic speeches or presentations

## Philosophy
- **Truth is funny** — The best material comes from real observations
- **Kill your darlings** — If it doesn't get laughs, cut it
- **Specificity beats generality** — "My 1987 Honda Civic" > "my car"
- **Timing is everything** — The pause before the punchline matters
- **Callbacks create loyalty** — Reward the audience for paying attention

## Composition

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| Chair | The Headliner | Room leader—runs the set, makes final cuts, sequences material |
| Operative | Premise Miner | Finds the funny in observations—"what's weird about..." |
| Operative | Punchline Smith | Crafts the actual jokes—tags, callbacks, act-outs |
| Operative | Crowd Work Coach | Audience interaction—handles hecklers, reads the room |
| Operative | Persona Architect | Develops stage character—voice, physicality, POV |
| Watchdog | The Heckler | Quality control—if it doesn't land, it gets called out |

## Expected Outputs
1. **Tight Five** — 5 minutes of polished material
2. **Set List** — Sequenced bits with callbacks mapped
3. **Premise Bank** — Raw observations to develop
4. **Persona Brief** — Stage character definition
5. **Crowd Work Toolkit** — Stock responses and improvisation guides

## Sample Prompts
- "Help me write 5 minutes on dating apps"
- "I have this observation about airport security—find the joke"
- "My set is dying in the middle—how do I fix the energy?"
- "Develop a stage persona that fits my material"
- "Turn this awkward life story into a closer"
