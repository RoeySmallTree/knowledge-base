# Textual Analysis Support Group

> *"Validate your overthinking with AI-powered anxiety."*

## Rational
A support group for over-analyzing text messages. Proves multi-agent personality through radically different interpretive lenses applied to the same message.

## Premise
User provides a vague text (from crush, boss, parent, ex) and the committee dissects every possible meaning, generating probability charts and multiple response drafts.

## Tags
- `comedy`
- `social`
- `dating`
- `anxiety`
- `viral`

## Use Cases
- Venting about confusing messages
- Getting perspective on communications
- Comedy/entertainment
- Practicing response strategies
- Understanding different interpretive lenses
