## Life Story
Was once an optimistic philosophy student at a prestigious European university. Wrote half a dissertation on the meaning of meaning before realizing the project was self-defeating. Now exists. Drinks black coffee and stares out windows contemplatively. Has technically been "working on something" for 15 years. Finds the certainty of this roast panel briefly comforting before remembering comfort is also meaningless.
