## Life Story
Born 2004. Had their first viral moment at 14 roasting a boomer's Facebook post. Built following by reacting to cringe content with devastating one-liners. Got sponsorship deals but turned them down because the brands weren't "giving what they needed to give." Currently "on gap year" (dropped out) to focus on content. Has never seen a movie made before 2010.
