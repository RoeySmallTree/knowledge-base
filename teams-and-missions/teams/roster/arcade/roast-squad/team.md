# The Roast Squad

> *"Turn self-delusion into self-awareness through brutal honesty."*

## Rational
Ego destruction through committee. Proves AI agents have distinct, clashing personalities by weaponizing different roasting archetypes against the user (or their target).

## Premise
A committee of professional ego destroyers analyze a target and systematically dismantle them through brutal, constructive humor. Each agent represents a different roasting archetype with specific cultural touchstones.
