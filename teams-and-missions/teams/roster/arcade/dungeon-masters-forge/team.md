# The Dungeon Master's Forge

> *"Full campaign prep in minutes, not weeks."*

## Rational
Unlike the Dungeon Party (where users DM), the Forge *creates* complete playable campaign settings from vague prompts. DMs spend 10-15 hours prepping per session; this team cuts that to 2 hours plus tweaks.

## Premise
A team of worldbuilding specialists creates complete playable campaign settings, NPCs, monsters, and treasure from minimal prompts. Every element is designed to be immediately usable at the table.
