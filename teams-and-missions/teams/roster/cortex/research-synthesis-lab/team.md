# Research Synthesis Lab

> *"Research that compares, finds contradictions, builds defensible thesis."*

## Overview

The Research Synthesis Lab reads large volumes of research papers and produces synthesis that maps contradictions, identifies gaps, and builds defensible theses. Unlike simple literature reviews, it actively compares and challenges findings.

- Systematic review

## Composition

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| Chair | Research Lead | Synthesis strategy and thesis development |
| Operative | Lit Mapper | Builds contradiction graphs and maps the landscape |
| Operative | Methodologist | Evaluates research quality and methodology |
| Operative | Critic | Spots bias, limitations, and alternative interpretations |
| Operative | Synthesizer | Builds coherent narrative from disparate findings |
| Watchdog | Citation Watchdog | Ensures every claim is properly sourced |

## Expected Outputs
1. **Literature Map** — Visual research landscape
2. **Contradiction Map** — Disagreements and debates
3. **Gap Analysis** — What's not yet studied
4. **Hypothesis Evolution** — How understanding developed
5. **Synthesis Document** — Integrated conclusions

## Sample Prompts
- "Synthesize research on X with contradiction mapping"
- "Build a literature map for my thesis topic"
- "What do studies agree/disagree on regarding Y?"
- "Identify gaps in the research on Z"
