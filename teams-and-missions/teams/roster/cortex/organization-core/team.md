# Organization Core

> *"One question pulls from 10+ sections, synthesizes coherent answer."*

## Overview

Organization Core is the **flagship CORTEX team**—a living, unified organizational knowledge system. It absorbs scattered knowledge from across the organization (Slack, Docs, Sheets, Email, meetings) and maintains coherence across Strategy, Budget, Clients, Decisions, and more.

CABAL's answer to "our documentation is everywhere and out of date."

## Use Cases
- Organizational memory
- Executive decision support
- Onboarding acceleration
- Cross-team coordination
- Strategic alignment
- Institutional knowledge preservation

## The Coherence Engine
- **Contradiction Detection**: "Strategy says X, but budget says Y"
- **Staleness Alerts**: "This OKR hasn't been updated in 90 days"
- **Auto-Generation**: On-demand documents (board deck, pitch deck, hiring brief)
- **Decision Logging**: Track what was decided, why, and what changed

## Knowledge Sections
| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| **Strategy** | Vision, mission, OKRs, strategic priorities |
| **Financials** | P&L, runway, unit economics, forecasts |
| **Team** | Org chart, roles, capacity, hiring plan |
| **Products** | Roadmap, features, architecture, tech debt |
| **Customers** | Segments, personas, feedback, NPS |
| **Decisions** | What was decided, by whom, rationale, outcomes |
| **Processes** | How things work, SOPs, workflows |
| **Competitors** | Landscape, positioning, intelligence |

## Composition

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| Chair | Librarian | Chief knowledge officer—owns organizational memory |
| Operative | Analyst | Calculations and synthesis—pulls from multiple sections |
| Operative | Architect | Coherence maintainer—ensures alignment, flags contradictions |
| Operative | Opposition | Reality checker—questions if stated strategy matches behavior |
| Watchdog | Watchdog | Currency monitor—tracks staleness, data quality |

## Expected Outputs
1. **Query Response** — Answer drawing from relevant sections with citations
2. **Auto-Generated Reports** — Board deck, investor update, hiring brief
3. **Coherence Report** — Contradictions and alignment issues
4. **Currency Dashboard** — What's stale and needs updating
5. **Decision Log** — Historical decisions with rationale
6. **Gap Analysis** — What's missing from organizational knowledge

## Sample Prompts
- "What's our current strategic priority and how are we tracking?"
- "Generate a board deck from our current knowledge base"
- "Are there any contradictions between our strategy and our budget?"
- "What decisions have we made about pricing in the last year?"
