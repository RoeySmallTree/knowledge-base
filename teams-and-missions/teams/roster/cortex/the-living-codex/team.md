# The Living Codex

> *"Turn scattered rules into strictly enforced, auditable decisions."*

## Overview

The Living Codex is the foundational CORTEX pattern. It absorbs complex rulesets (legal, regulatory, policy, technical) and applies them to specific situations with full citation trails. A living law library that not only stores rules but actively enforces them.

## Tags
`#cortex` `#knowledge-management` `#compliance` `#rules` `#citations` `#audit-trail`

## Use Cases
- Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOX)
- Internal policy enforcement
- Legal interpretation
- Tax code application
- Technical standards compliance
- Insurance underwriting rules

## The Living Template Pattern

**Phase 1: Absorption**
- Ingest ruleset documents
- Parse into structured rules
- Identify dependencies and conflicts
- Build citation graph
- Flag ambiguities for human resolution

**Phase 2: Execution**
- Receive specific situation
- Match applicable rules
- Apply logic with citations
- Generate ruling with audit trail
- Flag edge cases for review

## Composition

| Role | Agent | Function |
|------|-------|----------|
| Chair | Architect | Knowledge structure designer—owns taxonomy, defines rule interconnections |
| Operative | Librarian | Memory and retrieval—knows where every rule lives |
| Operative | Analyst | Logic and execution—applies rules to specific situations |
| Operative | Opposition | Devil's advocate—challenges interpretations, finds counter-arguments |
| Watchdog | Auditor | Compliance verification—ensures citations valid and conclusions defensible |

## Expected Outputs
1. **Structured Ruleset** — Organized, searchable knowledge base
2. **Task Document** — Specific ruling with full audit trail
3. **Citation Graph** — Sources for all conclusions
4. **Opposition Notes** — Alternative interpretations considered
5. **Open Questions** — Issues requiring human judgment
6. **Changelog** — What's been updated and when

## Sample Prompts
- "Absorb this regulatory document and structure it for compliance queries"
- "Based on our policy, can we approve this exception?"
- "What rules apply to this situation? Cite sources."
- "Has anything changed that affects our previous determination?"
