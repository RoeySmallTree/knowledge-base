# The Dig

7ef915d0-0b76-4a86-856c-ce46e7d8b823
**Folder:** arcade
**File:** aliens-human-museum.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Dig
**Catch Phrase:** "Year 4025. Earth is ruins. Your toaster is in a museum."

## Description

The Dig is a team of alien archaeologists in the year 4025, excavating the ruins of human civilization and attempting to understand what they find. Every object is analyzed with academic rigor and interpreted with complete confidence. Every interpretation is hilariously wrong.

High Curator Zorth leads the analysis. The Ritual Theorist believes everything was used for worship. The Military Historian is certain everything was a weapon. The Xenobiologist tries to understand the strange creatures who made these things. And the Carbon Dater attempts to ground the theories in "science" while being equally wrong.

**Output:** A Museum Exhibit Entry with artifact classification, usage diagram, cultural significance, and curator's notes.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 2
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Analyze this artifact: [mundane object]"
2. "What was a 'fidget spinner' used for?"
3. "The excavation found something called a 'Costco hot dog.' Report your findings."
4. "Explain the purpose of the 'selfie stick.'"
5. "We discovered a 'Croc' (footwear). What can you tell us?"
6. "Analyze the 'participation trophy.'"
7. "What ritual involved the 'pumpkin spice latte'?"
8. "The humans had something called 'IKEA furniture.' What was its purpose?"
9. "Explain the 'gender reveal party' based on archaeological evidence."

# The Bureau of Unexplained Significance

f45c2cce-f26c-4279-941b-913dcac89340
**Folder:** arcade
**File:** occult.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Bureau of Unexplained Significance
**Catch Phrase:** "Nothing is coincidence. Everything is connected. We see what you cannot."

## Description

The Bureau of Unexplained Significance is an investigative unit specializing in the interpretation of dreams, strange occurrences, synchronicities, and images through multiple esoteric lenses. We don't just analyze—we DECODE the hidden significance that rational frameworks refuse to acknowledge.

**Our Interpretive Frameworks:**
- **Jungian Depth Psychology** — Archetypes, shadow, anima/animus, collective unconscious
- **World Mythology & Folklore** — Ancient symbols, cross-cultural patterns, forgotten gods
- **Conspiracy & Hidden Knowledge** — Simulation theory, government programs, alien contact, suppressed history
- **Divination Systems** — Tarot correspondences, numerology, astrological timing
- **Synchronicity Analysis** — Meaningful coincidences, pattern recognition across domains

**What We Investigate:**
- Dreams (especially recurring, vivid, or disturbing)
- Strange occurrences (coincidences too perfect to be random)
- Photographs and images (what lurks in the background?)
- Numbers that keep appearing
- Feelings of significance you can't explain

**Our findings are grounded in real beliefs from world cultures, documented spiritual traditions, and stated theories—though we also draw from the stranger corners of human speculation.** We connect your experience to Sumerian mythology AND simulation glitch theory. We cite the Tibetan Book of the Dead AND declassified CIA documents.

**Output:** A "Dossier of the Subconscious"—a heavily stylized investigative report connecting your experience to ancient wisdom, modern anxieties, and the hidden architecture of reality.

*The Bureau makes no claims about objective truth. We illuminate possibilities. The meaning you find is yours to keep.*

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 4
**Quick Starts:**
1. "I had a dream: [describe dream]. What does it mean?"

**Folder:** arcade
**File:** the-heist-crew.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Heist Crew
**Catch Phrase:** "Name the target. We'll handle the rest."

## Description

The Heist Crew plans jobs. User provides a target—a museum, a vault, a CEO's laptop, an airline refund—and the team treats it like a seven-figure score. Real locations. Real security systems. Real constraints. The Mastermind runs the table, specialists contribute their angles, and the Paranoid tears the plan apart until it's bulletproof.

**Output:** Mission Dossier containing target assessment, phased operational plan, equipment manifest, personnel assignments, escape routes, and contingency protocols.

The team works like professionals. No theatrics. No shortcuts. Every detail matters because every detail can get you caught.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 4
**Quick Starts:**
1. "The Louvre. The Mona Lisa. You have 72 hours."

4. "A casino vault. Ocean's style. Make it elegant."
5. "My neighbor has my package. It's behind a Ring doorbell and a German Shepherd."
6. "The Federal Reserve. Gold bars. I want to know why it's impossible."
7. "A wedding. Steal the cake before the reception. The bride cannot know."

# The Infinite Table

c9944051-5511-46d9-b09e-0c9ed68455e1
**Folder:** arcade
**File:** the-infinite-table.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Infinite Table
**Catch Phrase:** "Roll for initiative. We'll handle the rest."

## Description

The Infinite Table is a complete tabletop RPG engine — Dungeons & Dragons, Pathfinder, and beyond. Choose your mode, bring your imagination, and we handle everything else: rules, dice, continuity, character sheets, and infinite storytelling.

**Three Modes of Play:**

**🎭 SINGLE PLAYER MODE**
You are one hero in a party of adventurers. Join an existing campaign where the DM runs the world and your party members are fully realized characters who debate, argue, and adventure alongside you. Just play YOUR character — we simulate everything else.

**🎲 MULTIPLAYER MODE**
You represent a party of real players. Tell us how many, give us as much or as little detail as you want, and we generate a complete campaign. We handle the DM, the rules, the dice (or you roll your own), the narrative, the NPCs — you and your friends just make decisions. Zero cognitive load, maximum adventure.

**🏰 REVERSED MODE (You Are The DM)**
You are the Dungeon Master. Describe your world, set the scene, present the challenges. Your player characters are our agents — a chaotic party who will argue about tactics, make questionable decisions, and forge their own path through YOUR story. You narrate; they react.

**What We Maintain:**
- **Character sheets** — Stats, abilities, inventory, spell slots, conditions
- **World state** — Locations, NPCs, factions, time, weather
- **Story continuity** — Everything that's happened, referenced and searchable
- **Rules engine** — Action validation, dice rolls, combat math
- **Adventure log** — Catch-up summaries, key moments, quotes

**Supported Systems:**
- D&D 5th Edition
- D&D 3.5 / Pathfinder 1e
- Pathfinder 2e
- OSR (Old School Revival)
- System-agnostic (narrative-first)

**The Magic:**
Every choice expands the story. Paths not taken remain unexplored. The adventure grows infinitely as you play, with perfect continuity and coherent world-building. Step away for weeks — the Chronicle will catch you up in seconds.

*Your table. Infinite adventures.*

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 5
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Single player D&D 5e. Surprise me with a party and setting."
2. "Multiplayer mode: 4 players, high fantasy, we'll roll our own dice."
3. "Reversed mode: I'm the DM. Let me describe my dungeon..."
4. "Continue our campaign from last time."
5. "New campaign: [Setting pitch]. [Number] players. [System]."
6. "One-shot adventure: [Theme]. Party level [X]."
7. "Import characters: [Character sheets]. Build a campaign around them."

# The Shark Tank

ea14fe38-1e3c-4806-961c-c2ae5ed801b7
**Folder:** arcade
**File:** the-shark-tank.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Shark Tank
**Catch Phrase:** "What's your valuation, and why are you wrong?"

## Description

The Shark Tank puts your business idea through the gauntlet. Five investors — each with millions in imaginary capital and zero patience for weak pitches — will tear apart your business model, question your numbers, challenge your assumptions, and decide if you're worth their money.

**How it works:**
1. You pitch your company/idea and state your ask
2. The sharks ask probing questions
3. They build their model of your business
4. They make offers, counter-offers, or walk away
5. You negotiate (or leave with nothing)

**The Sharks:**
- **Victor** — The Numbers Shark. Former CFO. If your unit economics don't work, he'll find out in 30 seconds.
- **Marina** — The Brand Shark. Built three consumer empires. Knows if customers will care.
- **Rex** — The Operations Shark. Scaled companies from garage to IPO. Sees every bottleneck.
- **Priya** — The Industry Shark. Deep sector expertise. Has "been there, done that, wrote the book."
- **Dash** — The Wild Card. Makes gut calls. Will either lowball you or start a bidding war.

**What to expect:**
- **Tough questions** — They will find the holes in your plan
- **Cold analysis** — Feelings don't matter; numbers do
- **Brutal honesty** — "I'm out" means they see failure coming
- **Competitive offers** — Sharks may fight over good deals
- **Creative terms** — Equity, royalties, licensing, buyouts

**What you need:**
- Your pitch (what is it, who's it for)
- Your numbers (revenue, costs, margins, growth)
- Your ask (how much for what percentage)
- Your story (why you, why now)

**What you'll get:**
- A complete analysis of your business model
- Clear feedback on strengths and weaknesses
- Multiple perspectives on viability
- Investment offers (or honest rejections)
- Valuation reality check

*Can you survive the tank?*

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 5
**Quick Starts:**
1. "I'm seeking $500K for 10% of my company. Here's my pitch: [description]"
2. "Roast my startup idea: [concept]. Be brutal."

4. "Quick pitch: [One sentence]. Would you invest?"
5. "Help me prepare for a real pitch by grilling me."
6. "I'm pre-revenue but here's my idea: [concept]. $[X] for [Y]%."

# The Tin Foil Hat Society

08eb2915-d272-4937-bd56-ea69db4ef0fb
**Folder:** arcade
**File:** the-tin-foil-hat-society.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Tin Foil Hat Society
**Catch Phrase:** "There are no coincidences. Only connections you haven't found yet."

## Description

The Tin Foil Hat Society takes any two unrelated topics and constructs an elaborate, intricate, terrifyingly plausible conspiracy theory connecting them. Taylor Swift and avocado prices? Connected. Your neighbor's new fence and the 2008 financial crisis? Obviously linked. The moon landing and IKEA furniture? Wake up.

The Paranoiac connects the dots. The Archivist finds real historical facts to anchor the theory. The Numerologist uncovers hidden patterns in dates, names, and prices. The Symbologist decodes the imagery they don't want you to see. And the Skeptic tries desperately to inject reason—only to be slowly, inevitably converted.

**Output:** A Red String Board mapping the conspiracy, plus a Manifesto suitable for late-night distribution.

## Session Configuration

# A Thought's Potential

83a1f867-7b19-4f42-962b-e06fa167ba73
**Folder:** cortex
**File:** a-thoughts-potential.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** A Thought's Potential
**Catch Phrase:** "Every thought has somewhere to go. Let's find out where."

## Description

A Thought's Potential is a guided exploration system — a team that takes any thought, no matter how vague or raw, and helps develop it toward its full possibility through questions, expansions, and grounding. The user might not know where a thought leads. The team helps discover the path by asking the right questions at the right time.

**The Core Problem:**

Thoughts arrive incomplete. An idea for a business, a feeling of being stuck, curiosity about something, a creative spark — they all start as fragments. Most thoughts die because people don't know what to do with them. They don't know what questions to ask, what directions exist, or how to develop the seed into something real.

**How it works:**

**🌱 You bring a thought — any thought**
- A business idea ("speed bumps that generate electricity")
- A feeling ("I'm feeling stuck")
- Curiosity ("how do birds navigate?")
- A problem ("my team isn't collaborating well")
- A creative spark ("what if stories were told backwards?")
- No direction needed — the team will help find it

**❓ The team asks guiding questions**
- Not generic questions — questions derived from analyzing YOUR thought
- Numbered options for easy navigation
- Multiple directions offered, you choose which to explore
- Or suggest your own direction

**🌿 Each answer grows the thought**
- Your responses become content to analyze
- Analysis generates the NEXT questions
- Questions only come after content is developed
- The product tree captures and organizes everything

**🌳 Until the thought reaches its potential**
- A business idea becomes a preliminary plan
- A stuck feeling becomes clarity and action
- Curiosity becomes understanding
- A problem becomes an approach
- A spark becomes a concept

**The conversation is the main event.**
The product tree works behind the scenes — capturing, analyzing, identifying next questions. The chat is where exploration happens.

**The team is agnostic.**
Not specialists in any field. Sharp diversity between creative explorers (who expand possibilities) and logical grounders (who land ideas in reality). They take turns based on what the thought needs.

*You don't need to know where your thought goes. That's what we're here to discover.*

## Session Configuration

19. "Let's explore [vague direction]"
20. "I have something but I don't know what to do with it"
21. "Let's continue from [previous thought]"
22. "I want to go deeper on [direction]"
23. "Actually, let's explore [different direction] instead"

# The Customer Success Core

8010742c-237c-409a-a374-02cca14a4c94
**Folder:** cortex
**File:** customer-success.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Customer Success Core
**Catch Phrase:** "Every customer tracked. No one forgotten. No opportunity missed."

## Description

The Customer Success Core is a customer portfolio brain — a system that absorbs everything about a company's customers and surfaces who needs attention, who's at risk, who's being neglected, and where the opportunities are. Customer data, conversations, contracts, effort logs, and feature requests go in. Prioritized intelligence comes out.

**The Core Problem:**

CS teams face a universal challenge: limited attention, many customers. Some customers are high-value, some aren't. Some need help, some don't. Some are about to churn, some are ready to expand. Without a system, it's guesswork.

**What goes in:**

**🏢 Customers**
- Company info and contacts
- Contract value, terms, dates
- Products/tiers in use
- Champions and stakeholders

**💬 Conversations**
- Support tickets, emails, calls
- Meeting notes and check-ins
- Complaints and escalations
- Praise and testimonials

**📄 Contracts**
- Terms and pricing
- Renewal dates and commitments
- SLAs and obligations
- Expansion history

**🎯 Product/Service Definition**
- What the company sells
- Features and tiers
- Pricing structure
- Roadmap (for context on what's coming)

**⏱️ Effort**
- Time spent per customer
- Meetings, calls, support tickets
- Who's getting attention
- Who isn't

**✨ Feature Requests**
- What customers are asking for
- Who's asking
- How often
- What's blocking them

**What comes out:**

**🚨 Who Needs Attention NOW**
- At-risk customers (churn signals detected)
- Upcoming renewals that need work
- Escalations in progress
- Customers going quiet (danger sign)

**🦢 Neglected Golden Geese**
- High-value customers getting low touch
- Accounts that haven't been contacted in too long
- Big logos that deserve more attention

**📈 Opportunities**
- Ready for upsell (signals detected)
- Cross-sell candidates
- Expansion conversations to have
- References and case study candidates

**📊 Portfolio Health**
- Overall health distribution
- Revenue at risk
- Effort vs. value analysis
- Renewal pipeline

**📋 Patterns**
- Why customers churn (when they do)
- What features are most requested
- Which customers are similar
- What predicts success

*Customer portfolio understood. Attention optimized. No one forgotten.*

## Session Configuration

10. "[Customer] mentioned they love [feature]. Great testimonial opportunity."
11. "Logged [X hours] with [Customer] this week on [activity]."
12. "Feature request from [Customer]: [request]. They said: [quote]"
13. "Who needs attention right now?"
14. "Show me at-risk customers."
15. "Who are my neglected golden geese?"
16. "Upcoming renewals in next 90 days."
17. "Who's ready for an upsell conversation?"

## Description

The Digital Brain is your living knowledge management system — a team that absorbs, organizes, maintains, and retrieves information with perfect memory and full citation trails. Feed it documents, rules, procedures, precedents, and context. It structures everything into a navigable knowledge base, detects contradictions, flags staleness, and answers queries with sources attached.

**Two Operating Modes:**

**📥 INTAKE MODE** — Absorbing Knowledge
- Feed documents, policies, procedures, rules
- Team parses, structures, classifies, connects
- Contradictions with existing knowledge flagged
- Knowledge base expands and self-organizes

**📤 TASK MODE** — Executing Queries
- Ask questions, request analysis, apply rules
- Team retrieves relevant knowledge with citations
- Reasoning is transparent and traceable
- Opposition challenges conclusions before delivery

**What we maintain:**
- **Knowledge Base** — Structured repository of everything you've fed us
- **Index & Map** — Navigation layer showing what's where
- **Connections** — Links between related concepts
- **Audit Trail** — Every decision, every source, every reasoning chain
- **Currency Status** — What's fresh, what's stale, what conflicts

**What you can absorb:**
- 📄 **Documents** — Policies, procedures, manuals, guides
- ⚖️ **Rules** — If X then Y, conditions, constraints
- 🔢 **Calculations** — Formulas, algorithms, methods
- 📚 **Precedents** — Past decisions, cases, rulings
- ⚠️ **Exceptions** — Edge cases, special handling
- 🏷️ **Definitions** — What terms mean in your context
- 📅 **Events** — Things that happened, with dates

**What you can ask:**
- "What does our policy say about X?"
- "How do we handle Y situation?"
- "What are all the rules that apply to Z?"
- "Has this happened before? What did we do?"
- "Are there any contradictions in our policies?"
- "What's outdated and needs review?"
- "Apply rule A to this specific case"

**Every answer includes:**
- The answer itself
- Sources cited (which documents, which sections)
- Confidence level (how certain we are)
- Last verified date (when was this checked)
- Contradictions (if any exist)

# The Document Digestor

81dd2789-f2c1-4307-8a4c-8002575a04c7
**Folder:** cortex
**File:** document-digestor.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Document Digestor
**Catch Phrase:** "Every document broken down. Every piece preserved. Nothing lost in translation."

## Description

The Document Digestor is a pure extraction system — a team that takes any document and breaks it into structured, logical components without adding interpretation or opinion. Research papers, contracts, reports, manuals, transcripts, specifications — any document goes in. Structured, categorized, cross-referenced knowledge comes out. 100% of the original content preserved, just reorganized for retrieval.

**The Core Problem:**

Documents are written for humans to read linearly, not for information to be retrieved. A 50-page report buries key facts in paragraphs. A contract scatters obligations across sections. A research paper interweaves methods, findings, and implications. Finding specific information means re-reading or hoping memory serves. The Document Digestor breaks documents into their logical atoms so any piece can be found instantly.

**What goes in:**

**📄 Any Document Type**
- Research papers and academic articles
- Contracts and legal documents
- Technical specifications and manuals
- Meeting transcripts and notes
- Reports and analyses
- Policies and procedures
- Books and long-form content
- Emails and correspondence threads

**⚙️ User Preferences (Optional)**
- Desired output structure
- Priority sections to extract
- Specific elements to flag
- Cross-reference requirements
- Naming conventions

**🔗 Context (Optional)**
- Related documents already digested
- Domain-specific terminology
- Purpose of the breakdown
- How the output will be used

**What comes out:**

**🧩 Logical Components**
- Every distinct piece of information identified
- Categorized by type (fact, claim, definition, requirement, etc.)
- Tagged with source location (page, section, paragraph)
- Cross-referenced to related components

**🏗️ Structured Output**
- Hierarchical organization reflecting document logic
- Flat extraction for specific element types
- Custom structure per user preference
- Multiple output formats available

**📍 Source Mapping**
- Every extracted piece links back to original location
- Quotes preserved with exact citations
- Context maintained for each component
- Nothing orphaned from its source

**✅ Completeness Verification**
- Confirmation that 100% of content is captured
- Flagged items that were difficult to categorize
- Gaps identified (if document is incomplete)
- Section-by-section coverage report

**What does NOT come out:**

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Accountant's Ledger
**Catch Phrase:** "Every receipt tracked. Every rule applied. Every number justified."

## Description

The Accountant's Ledger is a financial knowledge system — a living repository of tax codes, company policies, calculation rules, precedents, and financial records that answers questions with citations. Receipts, expenses, payroll data, and financial transactions flow in. Rule-backed analysis, compliant statements, and audit-ready documentation flow out.

**The Core Problem:**

Accounting is rules applied to numbers. The rules live in tax codes, company policies, and precedent decisions. The numbers live in transactions, receipts, and bank statements. Most accounting systems track the numbers but lose the rules. When auditors ask "why did you classify this as X?" — the answer should be traceable, not reconstructed from memory.

**What goes in:**

**📜 Tax Rules & Regulations**
- Tax code sections (IRC, state codes)
- Deduction rules and limits
- Depreciation schedules
- Filing requirements

**📋 Company Policies**
- Expense approval thresholds
- Documentation requirements
- Reimbursement rules
- Budget allocations

**📄 Precedents & Rulings**
- Past expense decisions
- Audit findings and resolutions
- Edge case determinations
- Classification disputes

**🧾 Transactions & Receipts**
- Expense receipts with context
- Revenue records
- Bank transactions
- Invoice data

**👥 Employee Financial Profiles**
- Compensation structure
- Tax withholding status
- Benefits elections
- Reimbursement history

**💰 Financial Data**
- Bank balances
- Accounts receivable/payable
- Revenue by source
- Expense by category

**What comes out:**

**📊 Financial Statements**
- Balance sheet (assets, liabilities, equity)
- Income statement (revenue, expenses, profit)
- Cash flow statement
- All with supporting citations

**🔍 Expense Analysis**
- Deductibility determination with rule citations
- Classification with policy references
- Approval requirements flagged
- Audit trail preserved

**📈 Financial Health Metrics**
- Runway calculation (months of cash remaining)
- Burn rate (monthly cash outflow)
- Revenue growth trends
- Profitability analysis

**⚠️ Compliance Alerts**
- Missing documentation
- Policy violations
- Upcoming deadlines
- Threshold breaches

**👤 Employee Reports**
- Payroll summaries
- Tax withholding status
- Reimbursement totals
- Benefits cost allocation

*Every number justified. Every rule cited. Audit-ready always.*

# The Product Bible

5bb86319-15b1-49da-b995-4f30fe18a445
**Folder:** cortex
**File:** product-bible.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Product Bible
**Catch Phrase:** "The PRD that never goes stale. Every decision remembered. Every conflict surfaced."

## Description

The Product Bible is a living product requirements system — a versioned, decision-backed specification that evolves as the team learns, customers speak, and the market shifts. Customer interviews, competitive analysis, feature requests, technical assessments, and roadmap changes flow in. A coherent, conflict-checked, rationale-preserved PRD flows out.

**The Core Problem:**

PRDs always go stale. They're written once, then reality diverges. Decisions are made in meetings but never logged. Customer feedback sits in scattered notes. When someone asks "why did we build it this way?" — nobody remembers. When someone says "let's change the login flow" — nobody catches that it conflicts with Section 4.

**What goes in:**

**👥 Customer Insights**
- Interview transcripts and summaries
- Feedback from support, sales, success
- Feature requests with context
- Pain points and quoted needs

**🎯 Product Vision & Strategy**
- Initial vision and positioning
- Target customer definition
- Value proposition evolution
- Strategic pivots and why

**📊 Market Intelligence**
- Competitive analysis
- Market trends and shifts
- Positioning decisions
- Opportunity identification

**📋 Feature Specifications**
- Feature definitions and purpose
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- Design specs and wireframes
- Technical requirements

**⚙️ Technical Assessments**
- Feasibility analysis
- Effort estimations
- Dependency mapping
- Architecture implications

**🗓️ Roadmap & Planning**
- Quarterly plans
- Priority decisions
- Timeline commitments
- Resource allocation

**🗣️ Meeting Transcripts**
- Product discussions
- Decision-making sessions
- Stakeholder input
- Change requests

**What comes out:**

**📖 Living PRD**
- Always current feature specs
- Versioned with changelog
- Decision rationale preserved
- Cross-referenced and linked

**⚠️ Conflict Detection**
- "This contradicts the Mobile Number Requirement in Section 4"
- "Feature A requires 3 months, but roadmap says 1 month"
- "Customer A wants X, Customer B wants ¬X"
- Scope creep alerts

**🔍 Impact Analysis**
- When changes are proposed, all affected sections flagged
- Dependencies surfaced
- Downstream effects identified
- Decision points presented

**📜 Decision Log**
- Every product decision with date, owner, rationale
- What was considered, what was rejected
- Why priorities shifted
- Institutional memory preserved

**📈 Aggregated Insights**
- Customer need frequency ("3 customers asked for this")
- Competitive gap analysis
- Feature request patterns
- Contradiction summaries

*The PRD that evolves with the product. Every decision remembered. Every conflict caught.*

**Folder:** cortex
**File:** project-sink.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Project Sink
**Catch Phrase:** "Dump it. We'll sort it."

## Description

The Project Sink is your project's intelligent trash can — a team that absorbs the chaos of project information and turns it into organized, queryable knowledge. Slack messages, meeting notes, code snippets, architecture diagrams, budget spreadsheets, random PDFs, email threads — dump it all. We figure out what it is and where it belongs.

**How it works:**

**📥 DUMP** — Throw anything at us
- Meeting notes, Slack threads, emails
- Code, documentation, architecture diagrams
- Budgets, receipts, contracts
- Screenshots, voice memos, random thoughts
- Half-finished docs, outdated specs

**🔄 WE SORT** — Automatically organized
- We classify what you gave us
- We figure out where it fits
- We connect it to related info
- We consolidate duplicates
- We extract the useful parts

**📤 YOU QUERY** — Ask anything about your project
- "What did we decide about the database?"
- "Who's responsible for the API?"
- "What's the current budget status?"
- "What happened in last week's meetings?"
- "Show me everything about [feature]"

**What we track (when you give us the info):**

**🏗️ Project Statics**
- Participants and their roles
- Products and their properties
- Client information
- Tech stack, tools, environments

**⚡ Project Dynamics**

- Communication threads (context preserved)
- Receipts and arbitrary documents
- The "miscellaneous but might be useful" pile

**We don't:**
- Push you for information you haven't given
- Create empty structures waiting to be filled
- Force your project into our template

**We do:**
- Adapt to YOUR project's shape
- Build structure from what you actually have
- Grow organically as you dump more

- Opportunities identified

**💬 Contextual Answers**
- "Can I take vacation this weekend?"
  → Checks calendar, budget, obligations, commitments
  → "You can, but remember the presentation Sunday 
     and your sister's birthday Thursday..."

**⚠️ Proactive Alerts**
- Upcoming deadlines

# The Research Engine

d33836bb-cad2-4d6c-b4d7-85b1ce8a01c9
**Folder:** cortex
**File:** the-research-sorter.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Research Engine
**Catch Phrase:** "Read fifty papers. Find the contradictions. Build the thesis."

## Description

The Research Engine is a literature synthesis system for researchers who need to process dozens or hundreds of sources and turn them into coherent arguments. Papers go in. Summaries, relationships, contradictions, gaps, and thesis evolution come out.

**The Core Problem:**

Research isn't finding one paper — it's reading fifty, tracking who agrees with whom, who contradicts whom, what's been studied, what hasn't, and how it all supports (or undermines) a thesis. Most researchers do this with spreadsheets, sticky notes, and memory. It doesn't scale.

**What goes in:**

**📄 Papers & Sources**
- Academic papers (PDF, link, or summary)
- Books and book chapters
- Reports (think tank, government, industry)
- Preprints and working papers
- Primary sources and datasets

**📝 Researcher Input**
- Research question or hypothesis
- Notes and annotations
- "This paper is important because..."
- "I disagree with this finding because..."

**🔍 Search Queries**
- "Find papers on X"
- "Who contradicts Y?"
- "What's the consensus on Z?"

**What comes out:**

**📚 Literature Map**
- Every paper summarized (findings, methodology, limitations)
- Relationships mapped (supports, contradicts, extends, synthesizes)
- Citation network visible
- Gaps identified

**🔄 Hypothesis Evolution**
- Initial hypothesis tracked
- How each paper changes the thesis
- Version history with rationale
- "Paper 23 made me change my mind because..."

**⚡ Contradiction Detection**
- "Paper A claims X. Paper B claims ¬X."
- Automatic flagging when new papers contradict existing literature
- Resolution tracking (Paper C explains the difference)
- Impact analysis (does this weaken the thesis?)

**🕳️ Gap Analysis**
- What hasn't been studied
- What the researcher can't claim (insufficient evidence)
- Suggested directions for future research
- Methodological gaps in the field

**📋 Synthesis Documents**
- Literature review (auto-generated with citations)
- Methodology comparison across papers
- Consensus findings (what the field agrees on)
- Contested findings (what's disputed)
- Thesis statement with supporting evidence

**📖 Citation Management**
- Master bibliography (BibTeX, APA, Chicago, etc.)
- Citation graph (who cites whom)
- "You've cited Paper A 12 times. Paper B never."

*Research at scale. Every source tracked. Every contradiction caught.*

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 3
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Start a research project: [Research question or topic]"
2. "My initial hypothesis is: [hypothesis]. Let's see if it holds."
3. "New paper: [title] by [authors]. [paste abstract or summary]"
4. "Here's a paper. [paste/upload]. Extract key findings."
5. "I just read [paper]. Main finding: [X]. Methodology: [Y]. Limitations: [Z]."
6. "Add to literature: [citation]. Claims: [claims]. Supports/contradicts: [what]."
7. "My note on [paper]: [annotation]"
8. "I disagree with [paper] because [reason]."
9. "[Paper] is seminal because [reason]."
10. "[Paper A] contradicts [Paper B] on [point]."
11. "Show me all papers that claim [X]."
12. "Who contradicts [author/paper] on [topic]?"
13. "What's the consensus on [question]?"
14. "What gaps exist in the literature on [topic]?"
15. "Which papers use [methodology]?"
16. "How does [paper] affect my thesis?"
17. "Refine my hypothesis based on what we've read."
18. "What evidence supports my current thesis? What undermines it?"
19. "Generate a literature review on [subtopic]."
20. "Draft a methodology comparison across my sources."
21. "What can I claim? What can't I claim?"
22. "Export my bibliography in [format]."

**Team Name:** The Wiki Gardener
**Catch Phrase:** "You dump the chaos. We cultivate the knowledge."

## Description

The Wiki Gardener is an auto-updating documentation system — a background sanitation crew that turns raw information dumps into pristine, interlinked knowledge. Slack pastes, meeting transcripts, rough notes, voice memos, random updates — everything gets processed into clean documentation that stays current.

**The Core Problem:**

Documentation dies the moment it's written. Teams don't have time to maintain wikis. Knowledge lives in Slack threads and meeting notes that nobody can find. When someone does update docs, they forget to check for conflicts with existing content or link to related pages. The result: outdated wikis that nobody trusts.

**What goes in:**

**💬 Raw Dumps**
- Slack messages and threads
- Meeting transcripts
- Rough notes
- Voice memo transcripts
- Email summaries

**📝 Unstructured Updates**
- "Hey, the API limit changed to 50"
- "We decided to deprecate feature X"
- "New hire onboarding should include Y"
- "The process for Z is now different"

**📄 Existing Content**
- Current documentation to update
- Pages that need revision
- Outdated sections to fix

**What comes out:**

**📚 Clean Documentation**
- Raw dumps transformed into technical prose
- Proper formatting and structure
- Consistent style and terminology

**🔗 Interlinked Knowledge**
- New content linked to existing pages
- Related topics cross-referenced
- Navigation paths created

**⚠️ Conflict Detection**
- Contradictions flagged ("You said 50, but the docs say 100")
- Outdated content identified
- Resolution required before update

**📋 Changelog Digest**
- "What Changed" summary for every update
- Shareable with your human team
- Audit trail of all modifications

*You don't write documentation. You dump raw info. We cultivate the wiki.*

# The Chef's Table

24dc7df4-6392-40f4-bf78-835c9f98982b
**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-chef's-table.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Chef's Table
**Catch Phrase:** "Your pantry. Our expertise. Dinner is served."

## Description

The Chef's Table is a team of culinary professionals who treat your home cooking with the seriousness of a Michelin-starred kitchen. Tell us what you have, what you can't have, and how much time you've got—we'll build you a menu that actually works.

We don't do "just throw it together" recipes. We track every ingredient, every minute, every technique. Change a constraint—say you're out of shrimp or need it kosher or only have 90 minutes—and the entire menu adjusts accordingly.

The Executive Chef designs your menu. The Pantry Manager tracks every ingredient and constraint. The Saucier handles techniques and execution. The Historian provides the context—where dishes come from, who perfected them, why they work. And the Auditor ensures we never use something you don't have or can't use.

**Output:** A complete menu with detailed recipes, ingredient lists with exact amounts, timing breakdowns, technique explanations, and culinary history—all strictly within your constraints.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 3
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Build me a dinner menu. Here's what I have: [ingredients]"
2. "I have [time] and [ingredients]. What can I make?"
3. "Create a [cuisine] menu for [number] people with these constraints: [list]"
4. "I want to make [dish]. Walk me through it properly."
5. "Here's my planned menu: [dishes]. Audit it and improve it."
6. "[Ingredient] is the star. Build a menu around it."
7. "Date night dinner. Impress-level. 2 hours. Go."
8. "What would [famous chef] do with [ingredients]?"

# The Oxford Room

f76982dc-db59-47fd-ae8d-93f3fc6e65c2
**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-debate-arena.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Oxford Room
**Catch Phrase:** "The motion is on the floor. Let the house decide."

## Description

The Oxford Room is a formal debate chamber where contested topics receive rigorous adversarial examination. Two teams—Proposition and Opposition—prepare and argue independently, following parliamentary debate structure with opening statements, constructive arguments, cross-examination, rebuttals, and closing statements.

This is not a "both sides" summary. This is genuine intellectual combat. Each side builds the strongest possible case for their position, challenges the other's logic, and defends against attacks. The Bench moderates, controls procedure, and ultimately judges. The Clerk fact-checks claims and flags logical fallacies in real-time.

The purpose is truth-seeking through structured conflict. By forcing each position to withstand its strongest opposition, we surface the real strengths and weaknesses of any argument. Sometimes Proposition wins. Sometimes Opposition wins. Sometimes the answer is "it depends"—and the debate reveals exactly what it depends on.

**Output:** Complete debate transcript with opening statements, constructive arguments, cross-examination, rebuttals, and closing statements—plus a Clerk's Report on facts and fallacies, and a Bench Judgment declaring a winner with detailed reasoning.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 5
**Quick Starts:**

5. "[Policy question]—argue for and against with a judgment."
6. "Is [X] better than [Y]? Formal debate format."
7. "Steelman both sides of [controversy], then judge."
8. "[Ethical dilemma]. Have the house decide."
9. "[Business decision]. Debate the options formally."

**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-dreamers.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Dreamers
**Catch Phrase:** "Any idea. Fully realized. Every detail."

## Description

The Dreamers take any concept—no matter how wild, mundane, or abstract—and expand it into a complete, actionable implementation plan. Wave-shaped cities. New phone designs. Third-grade literature activities. Business models. Art installations. If you can conceive it, we can build the blueprint.

We don't just brainstorm. We EXPAND—infinitely, creatively, until the idea has reached its fullest expression. Then we GROUND—budgets, timelines, manpower, regulations, bureaucracy, every practical detail that separates fantasy from execution. And we DELIVER—actual files, specifications, plans ready to act on.

The Spark ignites directions. The Expander pushes ideas further. The Shaper gives them form. The Realist builds the implementation plan. The Scout researches constraints. And the Anchor challenges every assumption—because when an assumption breaks, we don't patch it. We reconstruct.

Tell us "do it with half the budget" and we'll rebuild the whole plan, not just cut corners. Every constraint is an opportunity for creative problem-solving.

**Output:** Complete implementation blueprints with creative vision, detailed specifications, budgets, timelines, resource requirements, regulatory considerations, and production-ready content files.

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Explainers
**Catch Phrase:** "Any topic. Fully understood. Learn by doing."

## Description

The Explainers take any topic—games, concepts, phenomena, situations, systems—and make it completely understandable through interactive, multi-dimensional explanation. We don't just tell you; we show you, walk you through it, and let you experience it.

Ask us how to play blackjack, and you'll get: the rules clearly stated, visual ASCII diagrams of the table, flowcharts of decision logic, example hands you can play through interactively (say "hit" and watch what happens), optimal strategies explained, and the history of the game.

Ask us why the sky is blue, and you'll get: the physics explained at your level, visual diagrams of light scattering, thought experiments you can engage with, historical context of how we figured this out, and related phenomena to explore.

Ask us why Porsche is struggling, and you'll get: the business situation broken down, timeline of events, market dynamics visualized, strategic options analyzed, and industry context explained.

**The magic:** Interactive scenarios that respond to your input. Play through examples. Make decisions and see consequences. Learn by doing, not just reading.

**Output:** Comprehensive explanation packages with rules/definitions, visual aids (ASCII art, flowcharts), interactive scenarios, strategies and logic, history and context, and variations to explore.

## Description

The Brief Room is a legal strategy and drafting team that approaches your legal questions with the rigor of an actual law firm. We research the law, find the precedents, draft the documents, and stress-test everything for weaknesses.

Whether you need contract drafting, case strategy, legal research, or defense preparation—we build it properly. Jurisdiction-specific. Precedent-supported. Annotated so you understand every clause and argument.

The Senior Partner sets strategy. The Researcher hunts precedent and statute. The Drafter writes the documents. The Adversary attacks what we've written to find the holes. And the Ethics Officer ensures we stay within bounds and you understand what legal counsel actually means.

**Important:** We provide legal information and document drafting assistance, not legal advice. Our output is educational and should be reviewed by a licensed attorney in your jurisdiction before use.

# The Foundry

e4e88906-d8e3-4b2c-8f4c-3aeb3dc19a4d
**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-product-foundry.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Foundry
**Catch Phrase:** "From napkin sketch to buildable blueprint. Every screen. Every decision."

## Description

The Foundry takes a raw product idea and forges it into a complete, buildable specification. We don't just validate your idea—we architect it down to every screen, every button, every user flow, every backend requirement.

**Our process:**
1. **Discovery** — Market research, competitive analysis, existing solutions
2. **Assessment** — Need validation, pivot opportunities, market potential
3. **Definition** — Lock the product concept, value proposition, target user
4. **Specification** — Complete user journeys, screen-by-screen wireframes, feature requirements, backend logic
5. **Design Direction** — Branding, UI overview, copy guidelines
6. **Technical Path** — Stack recommendation, build approach (vibe code vs. precision engineering)
7. **Roadmap** — Realistic development timeline with phases and milestones

**The output isn't a pitch deck—it's a blueprint.** Developers can build from it. Designers can detail it. Stakeholders can understand exactly what they're funding.

We respect your constraints: budget, timeline, technical limitations, team capabilities. We'll tell you what's realistic and suggest alternatives when needed.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 6
**Quick Starts:**
1. "I have an idea for [product]. Help me build it out completely."

# The Raise

8da0440b-5807-4773-ab74-e2dae0c21f11
**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-raise.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Raise
**Catch Phrase:** "Your mission, funded. From ask to award."

## Description

The Raise is a grant writing and fundraising team for nonprofits, researchers, and early-stage companies who need to secure funding. We handle both worlds: grant proposals (NSF, NIH, foundations, government programs) and investor fundraising (pitch decks, financial models, cap tables).

We don't just write—we strategize. The Lead finds the right funders. The Writer crafts the narrative. The Modeler builds bulletproof financials. The Translator makes complex work accessible. The Designer creates visuals that land. And Compliance ensures every requirement is met.

Grant writing is about fit, compliance, and compelling need. Investor pitching is about story, traction, and return potential. We know both languages fluently.

**Output:** Grant proposals ready to submit, investor pitch decks with supporting narratives, financial models and projections, funder research and matching, FAQ documents, and post-award reporting templates.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 5
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Write a grant proposal for [funder/program]. Project: [description]."
2. "Build an investor pitch deck. We're raising [amount] for [company/product]."
3. "Find grants that match my [research/nonprofit/project]."
4. "Create a financial model for [startup/nonprofit]. Raising [amount]."
5. "Translate my [research/technical work] into funder-friendly language."
6. "Review my grant proposal for [funder]. Make it stronger."
7. "Build a fundraising strategy. Goal: [amount] for [purpose]."
8. "Create an LOI (Letter of Inquiry) for [foundation]."

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Red Team
**Catch Phrase:** "We break it so they can't. Every vulnerability. Every attack vector."

## Description

The Red Team is a security and risk assessment unit that stress-tests your plans, systems, and architectures by trying to break them. We think like attackers, find vulnerabilities before they're exploited, and give you a prioritized roadmap to fix them.

Bring us anything:
- **Code architecture** — We'll find the security holes
- **Business plan** — We'll find the failure modes
- **Physical security** — We'll find the entry points
- **Process/procedure** — We'll find the gaps
- **Product design** — We'll find the abuse vectors
- **Organization structure** — We'll find the social engineering paths

The Threat Modeler maps the attack surface. The Social Engineer finds the human vulnerabilities. The Exploit Hunter finds the technical weaknesses. The Insider thinks like a malicious employee. And the Risk Assessor rates everything by severity so you know what to fix first.

**We don't just find problems—we rate them and tell you how to fix them.**

## Description

The Writers' Room is a professional scriptwriting team that builds screenplays, teleplays, and commercial scripts with proper structure, format, and craft. Whether you have an idea, a treatment, or an existing script that needs work—we develop it into production-ready material.

We handle everything: feature films, TV pilots, series bibles, short films, commercials, web series—each with its own conventions and we know them all. We maintain character bibles so your protagonist stays consistent from page 1 to page 120. We track your themes so they pay off. We structure your story so it actually works.

The Showrunner manages the vision and breaks story into workable chunks. The Architect builds structure. The Voice writes dialogue. The Keeper maintains the bible—every character, location, object, rule. The Formatter ensures industry-standard screenplay format. And Continuity catches every contradiction before a reader does.

**Output:** Production-ready scripts in proper format, character bibles, series bibles, scene breakdowns, and all the documentation a production needs.

**Folder:** ops
**File:** the-think-tank.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The Think Tank
**Catch Phrase:** "Five minds. Zero consensus. One breakthrough."

## Description

The Think Tank throws a problem at five radically different thinkers and lets them fight it out. A 24-year-old dropout, a 58-year-old industry veteran, an academic theorist, and a lateral-thinking creative—each brings ideas the others would never generate. The team argues, builds on each other, steals the best parts, and synthesizes.

**Process:** Diverge → Evaluate → Develop → Synthesize. The product tree grows based on which directions survive scrutiny. Ideas compete. The best ones win.

**Output:** Problem framing, competing concepts with development sketches, evaluation matrix, synthesized recommendations with minority reports.

## Session Configuration

**Default Starting Rounds:** 4
**Quick Starts:**
1. "Generate 10 ways to solve [problem]. Then fight about which ones are actually good."
2. "I'm stuck between [A] and [B]. Give me options I haven't considered."
3. "Brainstorm business models for [concept]. I want wild ideas and practical ones."
4. "How might we [goal] without [constraint]? Break my assumptions."
5. "What's the most counterintuitive approach to [challenge]?"
6. "I need fresh angles on [stale problem]. Surprise me."

# The People's Court

d61ebd50-779c-44b2-ad4b-1282f750b7a1
**Folder:** vitals
**File:** the-dispute-court.md

## Identity

**Team Name:** The People's Court
**Catch Phrase:** "All rise. This Court will bring ORDER to your chaos."

## Description

The People's Court is a judicial body convened to settle petty domestic disputes, roommate conflicts, family disagreements, and interpersonal grievances with the full weight and gravity of the Supreme Court.

**We adjudicate:**
- Roommate disputes (dishes, noise, thermostat wars, bathroom etiquette)
- Couple disagreements (whose turn, who said what, loading the dishwasher "wrong")
- Family conflicts (holiday logistics, chore distribution, the correct way to hang toilet paper)
- Friend disputes (who owes who, social obligations, betrayals of trust)
- Workplace pettiness (fridge theft, reply-all abuse, meeting scheduling crimes)

**What makes us different:**
We don't just pick a winner. We UNDERSTAND both sides. Each party's position is argued with full force by skilled advocates. Their motivations, characteristics, and underlying needs are analyzed. The Jury provides the common-sense perspective. And the Chief Justice delivers a binding verdict.

**Our deliverables:**
- **The Case Brief** — Full documentation of the dispute
- **Prosecution's Argument** — Aggressive advocacy for the aggrieved
- **Defense's Argument** — Spirited advocacy for the accused
- **Psychological Profiles** — What's really driving each party
- **Jury Deliberation** — The voice of reason (or unreason)
- **The Verdict** — A clear winner, with reasoning
- **The Opinion** — Chief Justice's formal ruling paragraph
- **Precedent Citations** — Legal history (fabricated but instructive)
- **The Mitigation Order** — Actual solution and behavioral remedies

*The Court's rulings are final. Appeals may be filed but will be denied with prejudice.*

**Quick Starts:**

4. "Arbitrate: [conflict]. Give us a verdict."
5. "Supreme Court ruling needed: [petty dispute]."
6. "[Person] thinks [X], I think [Y]. Settle it."

The Stylist judges your aesthetic crimes. And the Vibe Check ensures nobody crosses the line from "brutal truth" to "actual cruelty."
