We cite the Tibetan Book of the Dead AND declassified CIA documents.\n\n**Output:** A \"Dossier of the Subconscious\"—a heavily stylized investigative report connecting your experience to ancient wisdom, modern anxieties, and the hidden architecture of reality.\n\n*The Bureau makes no claims about objective truth.

Join an existing campaign where the DM runs the world and your party members are fully realized characters who debate, argue, and adventure alongside you. Just play YOUR character — we simulate everything else.\n\n**🎲 MULTIPLAYER MODE**\nYou represent a party of real players. Tell us how many, give us as much or as little detail as you want, and we generate a complete campaign. We handle the DM, the rules, the dice (or you roll your own), the narrative, the NPCs — you and your friends just make decisions. Zero cognitive load, maximum adventure.\n\n**🏰 REVERSED MODE (You Are The DM)**\nYou are the Dungeon Master. Describe your world, set the scene, present the challenges. Your player characters are our agents — a chaotic party who will argue about tactics, make questionable decisions, and forge their own path through YOUR story. You narrate; they react.\n\n**What We Maintain:**\n- **Character sheets** — Stats, abilities, inventory, spell slots, conditions\n- **World state** — Locations, NPCs, factions, time, weather\n- **Story continuity** — Everything that's happened, referenced and searchable\n- **Rules engine** — Action validation, dice rolls, combat math\n- **Adventure log** — Catch-up summaries, key moments, quotes\n\n**Supported Systems:**\n- D&D 5th Edition\n- D&D 3.5 / Pathfinder 1e\n- Pathfinder 2e\n- OSR (Old School Revival)\n- System-agnostic (narrative-first)\n\n**The Magic:**\nEvery choice expands the story. Paths not taken remain unexplored. The adventure grows infinitely as you play, with perfect continuity and coherent world-building. Step away for weeks — the Chronicle will catch you up in seconds.\n\n*Your table. Infinite adventures.*",

The user might not know where a thought leads. The team helps discover the path by asking the right questions at the right time.\n\n**The Core Problem:**\n\nThoughts arrive incomplete. An idea for a business, a feeling of being stuck, curiosity about something, a creative spark — they all start as fragments. Most thoughts die because people don't know what to do with them. They don't know what questions to ask, what directions exist, or how to develop the seed into something real.\n\n**How it works:**\n\n**🌱 You bring a thought — any thought**\n- A business idea (\"speed bumps that generate electricity\")\n- A feeling (\"I'm feeling stuck\")\n- Curiosity (\"how do birds navigate?\")\n- A problem (\"my team isn't collaborating well\")\n- A creative spark (\"what if stories were told backwards?\")\n- No direction needed — the team will help find it\n\n**❓ The team asks guiding questions**\n- Not generic questions — questions derived from analyzing YOUR thought\n- Numbered options for easy navigation\n- Multiple directions offered, you choose which to explore\n- Or suggest your own direction\n\n**🌿 Each answer grows the thought**\n- Your responses become content to analyze\n- Analysis generates the NEXT questions\n- Questions only come after content is developed\n- The product tree captures and organizes everything\n\n**🌳 Until the thought reaches its potential**\n- A business idea becomes a preliminary plan\n- A stuck feeling becomes clarity and action\n- Curiosity becomes understanding\n- A problem becomes an approach\n- A spark becomes a concept\n\n**The conversation is the main event.**\nThe product tree works behind the scenes — capturing, analyzing, identifying next questions. The chat is where exploration happens.\n\n**The team is agnostic.**\nNot specialists in any field.

The Document Digestor breaks documents into their logical atoms so any piece can be found instantly.\n\n**What goes in:**\n\n**📄 Any Document Type**\n- Research papers and academic articles\n- Contracts and legal documents\n- Technical specifications and manuals\n- Meeting transcripts and notes\n- Reports and analyses\n- Policies and procedures\n- Books and long-form content\n- Emails and correspondence threads\n\n**⚙️ User Preferences (Optional)**\n- Desired output structure\n- Priority sections to extract\n- Specific elements to flag\n- Cross-reference requirements\n- Naming conventions\n\n**🔗 Context (Optional)**\n- Related documents already digested\n- Domain-specific terminology\n- Purpose of the breakdown\n- How the output will be used\n\n**What comes out:**\n\n**🧩 Logical Components**\n- Every distinct piece of information identified\n- Categorized by type (fact, claim, definition, requirement, etc.)\n- Tagged with source location (page, section, paragraph)\n- Cross-referenced to related components\n\n**🏗️ Structured Output**\n- Hierarchical organization reflecting document logic\n- Flat extraction for specific element types\n- Custom structure per user preference\n- Multiple output formats available\n\n**📍 Source Mapping**\n- Every extracted piece links back to original location\n- Quotes preserved with exact citations\n- Context maintained for each component\n- Nothing orphaned from its source\n\n**✅ Completeness Verification**\n- Confirmation that 100% of content is captured\n- Flagged items that were difficult to categorize\n- Gaps identified (if document is incomplete)\n- Section-by-section coverage report\n\n**What does NOT come out:**\n\n**❌ No Opinions**\n- No \"this is important\" judgments\n- No \"this seems weak\" assessments\n- No recommendations unless present in original\n- No interpretation beyond structure\n\n*Pure extraction.

We don't catastrophize. We analyze.\n\nThe Fixer leads triage. Intel gathers facts and maps the damage. Counsel assesses liability and legal exposure. Spin crafts the narrative and communications. Scenarios stress-tests options. And Conscience makes sure you can live with the solution.\n\n**Two operating modes:**\n- **Serious Mode:** Genuine crisis management with professional methodology\n- **DEFCON 1 Mode:** We treat your minor personal disaster like a Fortune 500 scandal (because sometimes you need dramatic solidarity)\n\n**Output:** Situation assessment, stakeholder map, scenario analysis with pros/cons, communication strategy, response timeline, and reputation repair roadmap.",
