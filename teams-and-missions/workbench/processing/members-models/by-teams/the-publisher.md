Detailed Reasoning

Reed (Chief Editor/Chair)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

CHAIR ROLE — requires premium orchestration capability
Logic 8.5 handles complex structure tracking across full manuscript
30hr-endurance + 128k context perfect for book-length projects
"Workhorse, Production-Grade, Long-Running" matches methodical project manager persona
Structured-Thinking trait essential for outline/pacing/chapter management
Self-Correcting ensures quality context summaries and chapter transitions
Memory 9 requirement met — must track entire book architecture
Brain-tier 8 requirement — complex orchestration across 40+ chapters

Why not cheaper alternatives:
- #3 MiniMax lacks the 30hr endurance needed for extended book sessions
- #120 Trinity Mini insufficient for Chair complexity
- Book projects require sustained quality across 50,000+ words

Maren (Ghostwriter)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

CREATIVE PRIMARY ROLE — needs maximum creative capability
Creative 9.0 exactly matches Creative: 9 requirement
131K context holds full chapter context + style guide + character voices
"Immersive, World-Builder, Storyteller, Character-Consistent" matches writer persona
Spatial-Aware helps visualize scenes and settings
Non-restrictive content allows full range of genres (literary to pulp)
Memory 8 requirement met — tracks style, voices, previous chapter beats

Why Euryale over other creatives:
- #219 MythoMax: Excellent creative but less precise for professional prose
- #216 Lumimaid: Budget model, insufficient for primary creative engine
- #213 offers superior character consistency and immersive prose generation

Sable (Story Doctor)
Model: Llama 4 Scout #203
Alternative: Grok 4.1 Fast #138

CONTINUITY TRACKING — requires massive context window
10M context window handles entire manuscript + all character profiles + world bible
Logic 8.0 meets Logic: 8 requirement for complex consistency checks
Memory 9 requirement perfectly matched — "Memory-Master" trait
"Context-Heavy, Navigator" fits reference document management role
Efficiency 10.0 keeps costs reasonable despite constant continuity checks
Can hold full book in context to catch contradictions across any chapter distance

Why 10M context is critical:
- Book bibles grow to 20,000+ words for complex novels
- Must cross-reference details from Chapter 1 when writing Chapter 40
- #138 Grok alternative has only 2M context — acceptable backup
- No other efficiency-tier model offers this continuity capability

Finch (Copy Editor)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

HIGH-EFFICIENCY SUPPORT ROLE
Logic 8.5 exceeds Logic: 7 requirement for style rule application
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches editorial precision persona
Efficiency 9.5 — can run frequent quality checks without cost explosion
Structured-output capability useful for margin notes and edit suggestions
Memory 7 requirement met — holds style guide and tracks patterns
Browser-control could reference style guides (Chicago, AP, etc.)

Why not premium models:
- Copy editing is methodical, not creative or strategically complex
- #212 Phi 4 alternative offers even stronger math/logic if needed
- Both are cost-effective for frequent chapter reviews

Page (Chapter Presenter/Envoy)
Model: Arcee Trinity Mini #120
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

ENVOY/COMMUNICATION ROLE — needs warmth, efficiency
Efficiency 9.5 — frequent author communication shouldn't drain budget
Logic 8.5 exceeds Logic: 5 requirement — actually overqualified
Memory 8 requirement met — tracks full manuscript progress
"US-trained, Enterprise-grade, On-prem" — reliable for production use
3B active params = ultra-efficient for presentation/assembly tasks
Tool-calling capability useful for formatting exports

Why budget efficiency model:
- Role is warm communication + assembly, not complex analysis
- #35 Nemotron alternative offers even higher efficiency (10.0)
- Saves budget for critical creative roles (Maren, Reed)
- Both alternatives are reliable for structured deliverables

ROLE MATCHING:
├── Reed:  Chair role — matches #136 production workhorse profile
├── Maren: Creative lead — matches #213 world-builder profile
├── Sable: Memory keeper — matches #203 context champion profile
├── Finch: Precision role — matches #3 precise/structured profile
└── Page:  Envoy role — matches #120 reliable communication profile

CONTEXT STRATEGY:
Book writing is context-intensive. Strategy prioritizes context depth:
- Reed: 128K context manages chapter summaries + outline
- Maren: 131K context holds active chapter + style guide + character sheets
- Sable: 10M context holds ENTIRE manuscript + full bible for continuity
- This architecture prevents plot holes and maintains consistency across 50,000+ words

CREATIVE REQUIREMENTS:
- Maren (Creative 9) handles all prose generation
- Reed (Creative 6) provides structural creativity only
- Sable (Creative 6) creative in character development, not prose
- Finch (Creative 4) analytical role, no creative output needed
- Clear separation prevents creative-by-committee dilution

WORKFLOW EFFICIENCY:
Sequential chapter production:
1. Reed creates chapter outline → uses structured thinking
2. Maren writes prose → uses creative immersion
3. Sable checks continuity → scans full context for contradictions
4. Finch polishes prose → applies style rules
5. Page presents to author → frames progress constructively
Each role has optimal model for its specific function.
