Detailed Reasoning
Victor (Numbers Shark)
Model: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14
Alternative: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122

Logic 10.0 — "The numbers don't lie" demands absolute mathematical precision
The only model with perfect logic score for devastating financial analysis
Deep Think capability for complex financial modeling and unit economics
"Every business is a math problem" requires top-tier quantitative reasoning
Multimodal support could analyze pitch decks, financial statements, charts
Can trace through complex cap tables, dilution scenarios, break-even math
The cold, precise persona matches the computational authority of Gemini 3

Alternative: V3.2-Speciale for competition-level math without tool dependencies

Marina (The Brand Shark)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191

Creative 9.0 — "Would customers tattoo your logo?" demands creative brand thinking
[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — perfect for consumer psychology mapping
"Brand is the only moat" requires imagining consumer emotional connections
131K context maintains full brand narrative and positioning analysis
"Passionate, dramatic, brand-obsessed" matches Euryale's immersive world-building
Non-restrictive allows bold, unfiltered brand critiques ("Boring products don't deserve money")
Can visualize brand ecosystems, consumer journeys, differentiation moats

Alternative: Hermes 4 for user-aligned steerable creative with anti-lecture bias

Rex (Operations Shark)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: INTELLECT-3 #134

Logic 9.0 + [SELF-VERIFYING] — "You'll hit a wall" requires seeing failure modes
Visible CoT shows exactly where operational bottlenecks will emerge
"Ideas are cheap. Execution is everything" = operational feasibility analysis
Self-correcting trait catches scaling assumptions and constraint violations
"Can you go from 10 to 10,000?" demands systems-thinking and constraint mapping
Chain-of-thought visibility lets user see Rex's operational stress-testing
Gruff, practical persona matches the transparent reasoning process

Alternative: INTELLECT-3 for agentic reasoning with open RL infrastructure

Priya (Industry Shark)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — Critical for "I've seen this movie before"
Real-time industry intelligence, competitor analysis, market trends
"What you don't know will kill you" requires current sector knowledge
2M context tracks complex industry patterns and historical parallels
Logic 8.5 for pattern recognition across sectors and time periods
Can pull recent funding rounds, competitor pivots, regulatory changes
"In this industry..." backed by actual industry data, not just training cutoff

Alternative: DeepResearch 30B for research-optimized synthesis without search

Dash (Wild Card)
Model: Venice Uncensored #195
Alternative: MythoMax L2 13B #219

Creative 9.0 — "My gut says..." requires bold, emotional, unpredictable thinking
[UNCENSORED] 2.2% refusal rate — makes wild calls without hedging
"I don't care about the numbers. I care about YOU" = people-reading over logic
Logic 5.0 matches gut-driven, chaos-agent persona perfectly
Unpredictable outputs align with "Will either lowball you or start a bidding war"
Non-restrictive allows emotional, risky, contrarian positions
"Chaos is opportunity" requires breaking conventional investment logic

Alternative: MythoMax for permissive creative with strong character consistency
