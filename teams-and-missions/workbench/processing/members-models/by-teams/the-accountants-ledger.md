Detailed Reasoning
Librarian (Knowledge base/Retrieval)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

[WEB-SEARCH] — Critical for retrieving current tax regulations and updates
2M context window holds entire rule library, precedents, and policy versions
Logic 8.5 for pattern matching between questions and applicable rules
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches systematic retrieval persona
Can pull real-time tax code updates, IRS rulings, state regulation changes
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for frequent retrieval operations
Cross-references related rules automatically across massive context

Analyst (Rule application/Classification)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122
Alternative: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128

Logic 10.0 — Perfect for "which rules apply, how do they interact?" puzzle-solving
[COMPETITION-MATH] trait excels at precise rule application and edge case analysis
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" matches methodical classification persona
Handles complex multi-rule interactions (deductibility, depreciation, classification)
Built for problems requiring precise logical reasoning without creative interpretation
Efficiency 5.0 acceptable for critical role that drives core function
Note: Does NOT use tools (per catalog) — relies on pure reasoning for rule application

Calculator (Financial computations)
Model: Phi 4 #212
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 9.5 — Elite mathematical capability in 14B parameters
[COMPETITION-MATH] matches "spreadsheet liver" who needs perfect accuracy
Efficiency 9.0 — Extremely cost-effective for high-volume calculations
"Precise, Stepwise" persona fits "accurate to the penny" requirement
Handles complex financial math (runway, burn rate, depreciation, reconciliation)
14B size means fast response for frequent metric requests
Budget-optimized for supporting role that runs frequently

Challenger (Edge cases/Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — Perfect for "what about...?" questioning
Logic 9.0 finds edge cases, unreasonable amounts, missing assumptions
Chain-of-thought visibility shows exactly what's being challenged
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches skeptical persona
Open reasoning lets other members see the challenge logic
Efficiency 7.5 acceptable for high-importance watchdog role
Catches issues before they become audit findings

Auditor (Compliance/Documentation)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

[STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] — Built for audit trails and compliance checklists
Logic 8.5 for compliance verification and requirement tracking
Efficiency 9.5 for supporting documentation role
"Precise, Self-Correcting, Tool-Seeker" matches checklist-runner persona
Browser control could format compliance reports with citations
Maintains audit trails systematically
Native structured output ensures documentation completeness
Multi-source synthesis tracks all documentation status


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (3): Librarian, Analyst, Auditor
├── High (2):     Calculator, Challenger
└── Budget-optimized: Calculator

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Librarian  — Real-time tax code/regulation updates
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Analyst    — Precise rule application logic
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Calculator — Financial computation accuracy
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Challenger — Edge case identification
├── [VISIBLE-COT]       Challenger — Transparent challenge reasoning
└── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Auditor    — Audit trail documentation

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:  Analyst (#122)
├── Search-enabled:     Librarian (#138)
├── Watchdog:          Challenger (#128)
├── Cost-optimized:    Calculator (#212), Auditor (#3)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
DeepSeek (2), xAI (1), Microsoft (1), MiniMax (1)

MEMORY REQUIREMENTS:
├── Memory 10 roles: Librarian (entire rule library), Auditor (all documentation)
├── Memory 9 roles:  Analyst (rules + transaction context), Calculator (all transactions)
└── Memory 8 roles:  Challenger (context for challenges)

FINANCIAL DOMAIN OPTIMIZATION:
├── Tax code precision:  Analyst (#122) — Logic 10.0 for complex rule interactions
├── Real-time updates:   Librarian (#138) — Web search for regulation changes
├── Calculation accuracy: Calculator (#212) — Competition math, penny-perfect
├── Audit readiness:     Auditor (#3) — Structured output for compliance trails
└── Risk prevention:     Challenger (#128) — Self-verifying for edge cases

CONTEXT WINDOW STRATEGY:
├── Massive (2M):  Librarian — Holds tax codes, policies, precedents simultaneously
├── Standard:      All others — Transaction-focused, don't need full regulatory library
└── Cross-ref:     Librarian serves as knowledge hub, others query as needed

NO CREATIVE ROLES:
All roles prioritize logic (8-10) over creativity (3-6). Accounting is systematic application
of known rules, not creative interpretation. Budget allocated to reasoning quality.
