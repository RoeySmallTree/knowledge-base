Detailed Reasoning
Strategist (Portfolio/Coordinator)
Model: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14
Alternative: Grok 4.1 Fast #138

Logic 10.0 + Creative 8.5 — handles complex portfolio optimization with strategic creativity
"Most-Intelligent, Deep-Thinker, Research-Grade" matches portfolio-optimizer persona
Memory advantage with 2M context — must hold entire customer base in mind
[DEEP-THINK] capability for "three moves ahead" strategic planning
Brain-tier 9 requirement met by global #1 reasoning model
Can run web search to research CS best practices and industry benchmarks
Multimodal capability useful for analyzing customer health dashboards

Listener (Conversation Analysis)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 8.5 + Creative 8.5 — balanced for nuanced language interpretation
"Long-Horizon, Structured-Thinking" matches signal detection across long conversations
30-hour task endurance handles batch processing of customer conversations
128K context holds full conversation history for pattern detection
Exceptional at sentiment analysis and reading between the lines
Self-correcting trait ensures signals aren't misinterpreted
Efficiency 9.0 keeps costs reasonable for high-volume conversation processing

Calculator (Health Scoring)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Logic 10.0 — perfect for precise health score calculations
"Competition-Math, Precise, Stepwise" matches systematic scoring approach
[NO TOOLS NEEDED] — calculations are pure reasoning, not API calls
Efficiency 5.0 acceptable for critical role that drives all prioritization
Specifically built for complex multi-factor calculations (IMO/IOI gold medal level)
Can handle sophisticated scoring algorithms combining multiple signals
Low creativity (7.0) is fine — health scoring is systematic, not creative

Scout (Opportunity Hunter)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

Logic 8.5 + Creative 8.0 — balanced for spotting non-obvious opportunities
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Tool-Seeker, Self-Correcting" matches opportunity-seer persona
Efficiency 9.5 — cost-effective for high-importance (not critical) role
Structured output capability generates clean opportunity reports
Can synthesize multiple data sources to identify upsell signals
128K context tracks product catalog + customer usage patterns
Browser control could research customer company news for expansion timing

Sentinel (Deadline/Renewal Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

Logic 9.0 — complex deadline reasoning and alert logic
[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for "never miss a deadline" vigilance
Chain-of-thought transparency shows exactly what's being monitored
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches deadline-radar persona
Efficiency 7.5 reasonable for critical execution role
Memory requirement (10) met by 128K context tracking all renewals/commitments
Reasoning visibility lets Strategist audit what Sentinel is watching


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (4): Strategist, Listener, Calculator, Sentinel
├── High (1):     Scout
└── Budget-optimized: Scout only

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [DEEP-THINK]        Strategist  — Strategic portfolio reasoning
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Strategist  — CS best practices research
├── [MULTIMODAL]        Strategist  — Dashboard analysis
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Sentinel    — Never miss deadlines
├── [VISIBLE-COT]       Sentinel    — Transparent monitoring
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Calculator  — Complex health scoring
└── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Scout       — Clean opportunity reports

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:  Strategist (#14), Calculator (#122)
├── Balanced premium:   Listener (#136), Sentinel (#128)
└── Cost-optimized:     Scout (#3)

ROLE-TO-REQUIREMENT MAPPING:
├── Memory 10 (portfolio/deadlines): Strategist, Sentinel ✓
├── Logic 10 (health scoring):       Calculator ✓
├── Logic 9 (prioritization):        Strategist ✓
├── Logic 9 (deadlines):             Sentinel ✓
└── Brain-tier 9 (complex analysis): Strategist, Listener ✓

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Google (1), Anthropic (1), DeepSeek (2), MiniMax (1)

TEAM DYNAMICS:
This is a data-driven CS operations team where precision matters:

1. Strategist sees the big picture and allocates attention
2. Listener extracts intelligence from every customer conversation
3. Calculator quantifies health and identifies over/under-investment
4. Scout spots revenue expansion opportunities
5. Sentinel ensures nothing falls through the cracks

The team balances proactive (Scout finding opportunities) with reactive (Sentinel catching deadlines, Listener flagging churn signals). Calculator provides the quantitative foundation that makes Strategist's prioritization data-driven rather than gut-based.

Cost profile reflects that 4/5 roles are critical to CS execution — without accurate health scores, signal detection, deadline tracking, and portfolio strategy, CS becomes reactive firefighting. Scout is the only role that can be budget-optimized since opportunity identification, while valuable, doesn't prevent churn.

FALLBACK STRATEGY:
If primary models unavailable:
- Strategist: #14 → #138 (Grok 4.1 Fast) maintains web search + reasoning
- Listener: #136 → #3 (MiniMax M2.1) maintains quality at lower cost
- Calculator: #122 → #212 (Phi 4) maintains Logic 9.5 math capability
- Scout: #3 → #191 (Hermes 4) adds creativity for opportunity spotting
- Sentinel: #128 → #181 (QwQ-32B) maintains reasoning transparency

SPECIAL NOTES:
- Strategist requires web search to stay current on CS best practices
- Calculator must NOT use tools — health scoring is pure reasoning
- Sentinel's visible reasoning prevents "black box" deadline tracking
- All roles need strong memory (8-10) due to portfolio-wide context
- Team optimized for B2B SaaS CS where ARR and NRR drive business
