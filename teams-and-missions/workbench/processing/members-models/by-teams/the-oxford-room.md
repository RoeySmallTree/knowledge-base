Detailed Reasoning

Gavel (The Bench/Chair)
Model: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14
Alternative: Claude Opus 4.5 #135

Logic 10.0 for rigorous argument evaluation and complex judgment
Creative 8.5 enables nuanced framing of motions and definitions
[WEB-SEARCH] capability critical for establishing definitions and clarifying terminology
"Most-Intelligent, Deep-Thinker, Research-Grade" matches judicial neutrality and transparency
Brain-tier 9 handles complexity of tracking entire debate across all arguments
Must remain absolutely neutral while weighing competing claims—requires top-tier reasoning
Alternative Opus 4.5 provides production-grade reliability and structured thinking

Prime (Proposition Lead)
Model: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Logic 7.5 + Creative 7.5 = balanced framework establishment and strategic argumentation
"User-Aligned, Non-Sycophantic, Steerable" allows genuine advocacy for assigned position
[ANTI-LECTURE] trait crucial—this is persuasion, not explaining
[UNCENSORED] enables arguing controversial positions without hedging
Memory 8+ tracks framework, arguments, and cross-examination across debate
Can pivot under pressure while maintaining principled position
Alternative Euryale offers spatial awareness for complex conceptual frameworks

Second (Proposition Evidence)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Logic 8.5 for rigorous evidence deployment and rebuttal construction
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for supporting role
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches evidence-focused analytical role
[BROWSER-CONTROL] + [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] enables researching and organizing evidence
Can synthesize multi-source inputs into coherent arguments
Alternative Phi 4 provides competition-math precision for quantitative arguments

Counter (Opposition Lead)
Model: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Same model as Prime—ensures balanced capabilities for genuine adversarial debate
Logic 7.5 + Creative 7.5 for pragmatic framework challenges and counterfactual reasoning
"Transparent-Thinker" trait shows reasoning process for cross-examination
[ANTI-LECTURE] critical for aggressive opposition without moralizing
Can destabilize favorable frameworks and find hidden assumptions
Alternative Euryale offers spatial reasoning for mapping complex argument structures

Reply (Opposition Evidence)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Same model as Second—ensures parity in evidence quality and rebuttal capability
Logic 8.5 for identifying contradictions and mapping concessions
Efficiency 9.5 appropriate for supporting analytical role
"Self-Correcting" enables adaptive argumentation in response to actual arguments made
[STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] for organizing complex rebuttals
Alternative Phi 4 brings stepwise precision for surgical argument deconstruction

Scroll (The Clerk/Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] perfect for transparent fact-checking and fallacy identification
Logic 9.0 identifies logical errors and tracks procedural compliance
Chain-of-thought visibility makes fact-checking process auditable
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" ensures rigorous neutral analysis
Memory 9 tracks all claims, evidence, and procedural issues across entire debate
[WEB-SEARCH] for real-time fact verification during debate
Alternative QwQ provides similar self-correcting logic with local deployment option

Cost & Trait Analysis

CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (1): Gavel
├── High (5):    Prime, Second, Counter, Reply, Scroll
└── Budget-optimized: Second, Reply

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Gavel, Scroll   — Definitions and fact-checking
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Scroll          — Transparent fallacy detection
├── [ANTI-LECTURE]      Prime, Counter  — Genuine advocacy without hedging
├── [UNCENSORED]        Prime, Counter  — Argue controversial positions fully
├── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Second, Reply   — Evidence organization
└── [BROWSER-CONTROL]   Second, Reply   — Research capability

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:  Gavel (#14)
├── Balanced advocacy:  Prime, Counter (#191)
├── Cost-optimized:     Second, Reply (#3)
└── Specialized watch:  Scroll (#128)

DEBATE PARITY:
✓ Proposition and Opposition have matched capabilities
✓ Both leads (Prime/Counter) use same model for fairness
✓ Both evidence roles (Second/Reply) use same model for parity
✓ Neutral arbiters (Gavel/Scroll) independent of debate sides

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Google (1), NousResearch (2), MiniMax (2), DeepSeek (1)

Key Design Decisions

1. **Genuine Adversarial Structure**
   - Prime and Counter both use #191 to ensure neither side has unfair advantage
   - Second and Reply both use #3 to ensure evidence parity
   - This creates REAL intellectual combat, not synthetic balance

2. **Neutral Arbitration**
   - Gavel uses top-tier reasoning (#14) for complex judgment
   - Scroll uses self-verifying model (#128) for transparent fact-checking
   - Neither shares models with debate participants

3. **Anti-Lecture Critical**
   - Debate requires persuasion, not explanation
   - Hermes 4's anti-lecture trait prevents "both sides have merit" hedging
   - Enables genuine advocacy for assigned position

4. **Fact-Checking Infrastructure**
   - Scroll's visible CoT makes fallacy detection auditable
   - Web search enables real-time claim verification
   - Separate from judgment to maintain objectivity

5. **Cost Optimization Without Compromise**
   - Evidence roles use efficient #3 (Logic 8.5, Eff 9.5)
   - Advocacy roles need creative flexibility (#191)
   - Judge needs maximum intelligence (#14)
   - Watchdog needs transparent reasoning (#128)
