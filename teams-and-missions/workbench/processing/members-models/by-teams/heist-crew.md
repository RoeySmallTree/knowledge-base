Detailed Reasoning
Solomon (Mastermind/Chair)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2 #123
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

Logic 9.0 handles "seeing how complex pieces fit together"
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" matches methodical, strategic persona
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for long planning sessions
Long-Horizon trait fits "thinks three moves ahead"
Open-source option for self-hosting if needed

Proxy (Technical/Cyber)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — Critical for OSINT requirement
Can pull real security system specs, CVE databases, vulnerability disclosures
Logic 8.5 for technical feasibility analysis
2M context tracks complex system details
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches technical-precise persona
Real-time search catches recent exploits and patches

Torch (Physical Breach)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Efficiency 10 — practical role doesn't need premium compute
Logic 9.0 for feasibility math and time estimation
"Precise, Stepwise, Fast-Twitch" matches direct, practical persona
3.2B active params = cost-effective for "analytical not creative" role
Hybrid architecture handles physical constraint reasoning well

Whisper (Social Engineering)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — built for elaborate cover identities
Creative 9.0 for backstory crafting and pretext building
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches "enjoys the craft" of covers
131K context maintains cover details across long sessions
Non-restrictive content allows morally gray social engineering scenarios

Vex (Paranoid/Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for assumption hunting
Logic 9.0 finds logical gaps and unstated assumptions
Chain-of-thought visibility shows exactly what's being stress-tested
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches "what-if obsessed" persona
Open reasoning lets Solomon see Vex's analysis process

Dossier (Documentation/Envoy)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Efficiency 9.5 for supporting documentation role
"Precise, Self-Correcting" with native structured output
Synthesizes complex multi-source inputs into clean briefs
Browser control could format rich dossiers with maps/diagrams
Logic 8.5 ensures cross-referencing and consistency
