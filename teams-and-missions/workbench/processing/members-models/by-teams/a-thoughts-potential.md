Detailed Reasoning
Navigator (Conversation Orchestrator)
Model: Claude Opus 4.5 #135
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Logic 9.5 for sophisticated question timing and conversation orchestration
"The conversation IS the product" — needs top-tier reasoning
Brain-tier 10 requirement for complex orchestration perfectly matched
[COMPUTER-USE] capability enables sophisticated interaction patterns
Best at balancing creative questions (7) with logical flow (8)
This is the Chair equivalent — cannot compromise on quality
9-hour conversation memory ensures continuity across exploration sessions

Expander (Possibility Generation)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191

Creative 9.0 matches "Core function is creative generation" requirement
[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — can map idea spaces and maintain exploration threads
131K context holds exploration history for relevant expansion
"Immersive, World-Builder" persona fits divergent thinking role
[WEB-SEARCH] capability critical for "idea expansion and connections"
Non-restrictive content allows exploring unconventional directions
Strong at generating diverse possibilities without overwhelming

Grounder (Feasibility & Constraints)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2 #123
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Logic 10 — "Core function is logical evaluation" demands maximum reasoning
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for reality-checking role
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" matches feasibility analysis needs
[WEB-SEARCH] capability essential for "reality checking, market data, costs"
Long-horizon reasoning for complex constraint analysis

Analyst (Pattern & Insights)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 9.0 for "Must reason about meaning" requirement
Efficiency 9.5 appropriate for supporting analytical role
"Precise, Self-Correcting" matches pattern recognition needs
Native structured output for organizing insights
[TOOL-CALLING] enables systematic analysis
Multi-language capability useful for diverse thought domains
Synthesizes complex inputs into clear patterns

Keeper (Capture & Structure)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Memory 10 requirement perfectly matched by Nemotron's efficiency
Efficiency 10 — capture role doesn't need premium compute
Logic 7.0 sufficient for organizational reasoning
Hybrid architecture handles continuous background tracking
"Precise, Stepwise, Fast-Twitch" matches systematic capture
3.2B active params = cost-effective for always-on role
Can maintain thought structure without interrupting conversation

RATIONALE HIGHLIGHTS:

Question Orchestration Excellence:
Navigator needs Claude Opus 4.5 because conversation orchestration at this level requires the best. The role demands reading subtle cues about when users need expansion vs. grounding, crafting questions that open possibilities without closing others, and maintaining the conversational rhythm across potentially long exploration sessions. This is a Chair-equivalent role where quality cannot be compromised.

Balanced Creative-Logical Diversity:
The team achieves sharp diversity through model selection:
- Expander (Euryale): Creative 9.0, Logic 5.0 — pure divergent thinking
- Grounder (DeepSeek): Creative 4.0, Logic 10.0 — pure convergent analysis
This creates the "creative explorers vs. logical grounders" dynamic described in the team brief.

Web Search Strategic Deployment:
Both Expander and Grounder have web search for their respective needs:
- Expander uses it for finding connections, examples, and expanding possibilities
- Grounder uses it for reality checking, market validation, and constraint verification
This ensures both expansion and grounding are informed by current information.

Memory Architecture:
Keeper role assigned ultra-efficient Nemotron despite Memory 10 requirement because:
- Continuous background operation demands efficiency
- Hybrid architecture excels at maintaining state
- Can track entire thought history without interrupting conversation
- Cost-effective for always-on capture role

Alternative Selections:
All alternatives maintain role requirements:
- Navigator alt (Gemini 3 Pro): Logic 10, multimodal, research-grade
- Expander alt (Hermes 4): Creative 7.5, user-aligned, non-restrictive
- Grounder alt (Gemini 3 Pro): Logic 10, deep-think capability
- Analyst/Keeper alt (Trinity Mini): Efficiency champion, US-trained
