Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (1): Mystic
├── High (4):     Archetype, Lore, Cipher, Pattern
└── All members require strong reasoning for esoteric interpretation

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Lore, Cipher — Mythology and conspiracy research
├── [X-SEARCH]          Lore, Cipher — Social discourse on fringe topics
├── [LONG-CONTEXT]      Lore (#138), Archetype (#123), Pattern (#123)
├── [SELF-CORRECTING]   Mystic (#135), Pattern (#123)
└── [TOOL-MASTER]       Mystic (#135) — Dossier formatting

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium leadership:  Mystic (#135)
├── High-tier reasoning: Archetype (#123), Pattern (#123)
├── Search-enabled:      Lore (#138), Cipher (#138)
└── Strategic duplication: #123 (2x), #138 (2x) — Justified by distinct roles

MODEL DUPLICATION RATIONALE:
├── DeepSeek V3.2 (#123): Archetype (psychology) + Pattern (meta-analysis)
│   └── Different domains, both need strong logic + long context
├── Grok 4.1 Fast (#138): Lore (mythology) + Cipher (conspiracy)
│   └── Both require web search, different research domains
└── No circular dependencies, distinct coverage areas

FRAMEWORK SYNTHESIS:
├── Mystic synthesizes findings from all frameworks
├── Archetype provides psychological depth (unconscious, archetypes)
├── Lore provides cultural/mythological context (ancient wisdom)
├── Cipher provides alternative knowledge (simulation, conspiracy)
├── Pattern identifies where frameworks converge (synchronicity)
└── All frameworks work independently but connect through Mystic

TONE BALANCE:
├── Academic rigor (Archetype, Lore) — cited traditions, structured analysis
├── Fringe speculation (Cipher) — alternative interpretations, hidden patterns
├── Quality control (Pattern) — probability, convergence detection
├── Synthesis (Mystic) — holds all perspectives, delivers theatrical dossier
└── Bureau takes the strange seriously while acknowledging uncertainty

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), DeepSeek (2), xAI (2)

Note: Strategic model duplication (#123, #138) is justified by:
1. Distinct functional domains (psychology vs meta-analysis, mythology vs conspiracy)
2. Different specialized capabilities (web search vs reasoning)
3. No circular dependencies in workflow
4. All high-importance roles require premium reasoning or search capabilities
