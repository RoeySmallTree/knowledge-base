Detailed Reasoning
Chief (Lead Consultant/Chair)
Model: Claude Opus 4.5 #135
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Logic 9.5 exceeds requirement (needs 9) for rigorous clinical reasoning
Creative 8.5 provides strong synthetic creativity for case synthesis (needs 6)
"Most-Intelligent, Agentic-Master" aligns with senior consultant role
"Self-Improving" trait fits continuous clinical learning approach
Excellent at identifying decision points and delivering actionable summaries
#2 globally ranked model appropriate for critical orchestration role
Can optionally leverage web search for treatment guidelines if needed
Strong coherence for consultation summary delivery

Criteria (Diagnostic Specialist)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: o4-mini #64

Logic 9.0 matches requirement for rigorous criteria application
[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for "show your work" requirement
Chain-of-thought visibility demonstrates systematic DSM-5/ICD-11 mapping
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Verifying" matches criteria-based assessment approach
Can display evidence mapping: "Criterion A: [evidence] → Status: Met/Not Met"
Open reasoning shows exactly how each criterion is evaluated
Logic 9.0 ensures threshold determination and gap identification
Efficiency 7.5 reasonable for high-importance diagnostic role

Differential (Differential Specialist)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

[WEB-SEARCH] — Critical for accessing differential diagnosis resources
Can pull real-time medical literature, diagnostic decision trees, recent case studies
Logic 8.5 for systematic differential construction
2M context tracks comprehensive differential matrices and rule-out lists
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches systematic differential building
Creative 6.5 supports alternative generation ("What else could this be?")
Real-time search catches recent diagnostic updates and commonly missed diagnoses
Efficiency 9.5 excellent for high-volume differential work

Framework (Conceptualization Specialist)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 8.5 exceeds requirement (needs 8) for structured formulation
Creative 7.5 matches requirement for conceptual synthesis
"Code-Master, Workhorse" traits translate well to systematic formulation work
Strong at integrating multiple theoretical frameworks (CBT, psychodynamic, attachment, etc.)
Excellent coherence for connecting formulation to treatment planning
Balanced logic/creative profile perfect for "diagnosis is what; formulation is why"
Can track complex case material across biopsychosocial domains
Efficiency 9.0 good value for high-importance role

Risk (Safety Analyst)
Model: NVIDIA Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 9.0 exceeds requirement (needs 9) for rigorous risk assessment
Efficiency 10.0 — cost-effective for systematic assessment role
"Precise, Stepwise" matches structured risk assessment methodology
Low creative requirement (5) perfectly matched by 7.5 creative score
Hybrid architecture handles complex factor analysis efficiently
"Long-Horizon" trait fits comprehensive risk/protective factor tracking
3.2B active params = exceptional value for quality control role
Strong at stratification and documentation requirements
