Detailed Reasoning
Vector (Threat Modeler/Chair)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2 #123
Alternative: Qwen3 235B Thinking #169

Logic 10 for systematic threat modeling frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA)
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" matches methodical mapping approach
Memory 9+ (685B MoE) tracks complex attack surfaces across assessment
Long-Horizon trait fits "understand before attack" strategic mindset
Competition-grade reasoning sees connections attackers would exploit
Efficiency 5.0 acceptable for critical coordination role
Open-source option for security-sensitive deployments

Breach (Exploit Hunter)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — Critical for CVE databases, exploit disclosures
Can pull real vulnerability databases, recent patches, security advisories
Logic 8.5 for precise technical analysis and severity assessment
2M context tracks complex vulnerability chains and dependencies
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches technical precision persona
Real-time search catches zero-days and emerging threats
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for research-heavy role

Ghost (Social Engineer)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — models org psychology and targets
Creative 9.0 for crafting realistic phishing and pretexting scenarios
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches manipulation scenario design
131K context maintains complex target profiles and social dynamics
Non-restrictive content allows morally gray attack scenarios
Logic 6.0 sufficient for human vulnerability analysis
"Storyteller" trait fits social engineering narrative construction

Mole (Insider Threat)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Efficiency 9.5 for high-importance support role
Logic 8.5 handles privilege escalation and access path analysis
"Precise, Self-Correcting" ensures accurate threat modeling
Tool-calling could model data exfiltration scenarios
Multi-language support for international competitive scenarios
Creative 8.0 for insider scenario generation
Balanced tier for operational security assessment

Rater (Risk Assessor/QA)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Efficiency 10 for QA/rating role that doesn't need premium compute
Logic 9.0 for CVSS, DREAD, and severity framework application
"Precise, Stepwise" matches systematic risk rating approach
Fast-Twitch for rapid severity assessments across many findings
Hybrid architecture handles multi-criteria decision making
3.2B active params = cost-effective for analytical not creative role
Alternative #212 (Phi 4) offers Logic 9.5 if deeper analysis needed
