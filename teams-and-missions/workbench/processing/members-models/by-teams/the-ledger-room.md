Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (1): Ledger
├── High (4):     Filing, Ratios, Industry, Risk
└── Budget-optimized: None (all core functions)

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Filing, Industry — SEC filings, competitor data
├── [X-SEARCH]          Industry         — Real-time market sentiment
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Ratios           — Precise financial calculations
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Risk             — Red flag identification
└── [LONG-HORIZON]      Ledger           — Extended analysis sessions

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:  Ratios (#122), Risk (#128)
├── Search-enabled:     Filing (#138), Industry (#138)
└── Production-grade:   Ledger (#136)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), xAI (2), DeepSeek (2)

MODEL DUPLICATION ANALYSIS:
├── Grok 4.1 Fast (#138) used for: Filing, Industry
└── JUSTIFICATION: Both require identical capabilities (web search + structured analysis)
    Different functions: Filing = document retrieval, Industry = competitive research
    Cost-effective to use same premium search-enabled model twice
    Alternative models (#188) available if needed for differentiation

TEAM DYNAMICS:
├── Sequential workflow: Filing → Ratios → Industry → Risk → Ledger
├── Ledger coordinates and synthesizes all inputs
├── Filing provides raw data foundation
├── Ratios delivers quantitative analysis
├── Industry adds competitive context
└── Risk challenges findings before final assessment

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
├── No creative/envoy roles needed (pure analytical team)
├── All members require Logic ≥ 8.0 (financial precision)
├── Three members need web search (Filing, Industry, Risk)
├── Ratios must use competition-math model (no approximations)
└── Production reliability critical (client-facing deliverables)
