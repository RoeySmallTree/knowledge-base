Detailed Reasoning

Marcus (Protocol Architect/Chair)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 8.5 handles complex systems thinking and cross-domain integration
"Deep-Thinker, Tool-Seeker, Self-Correcting" matches systems-focused coordinator
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for extended protocol design sessions
Memory requirement (8) satisfied by strong context handling
[STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] helps format integrated protocol stacks clearly
Browser control could pull latest biohacking research when needed
#1 open-source model provides reliability for critical coordination role

Luna (Sleep Scientist)
Model: R1 Distill Qwen 32B #130
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 8.0 handles sleep science reasoning and troubleshooting
"Dense, Local" — efficient model for analytical, not creative role
Efficiency 9.0 keeps costs down for support specialist
Low creativity (5) matches analytical sleep analysis focus
Can diagnose patterns and explain circadian mechanisms clearly
Cost-effective for high-volume consultations

Sage (Nutritionist)
Model: Phi 4 #212
Alternative: Qwen2.5 Coder 32B #183

Logic 9.5 (!) in 14B model — exceptional reasoning for nutrition science
Efficiency 9.0 makes this viable for high-volume nutrition consultations
Can handle complex dietary calculations and macro optimization
Strong at identifying high-leverage nutritional interventions
Competition-level math ability helps with precise macro/calorie calculations
Budget-friendly for support specialist role

Cole (Performance Trainer)
Model: Phi 4 #212
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 9.5 handles exercise programming and progression calculations
Efficiency 9.0 keeps costs reasonable for workout design
Can create structured programs with proper periodization
Strong reasoning for scaling workouts to constraints
Same model as Sage (acceptable for two support specialists)
Budget-friendly while maintaining high capability

Rei (Recovery Specialist)
Model: Lunaris 8B #215
Alternative: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216

Creative 7.5 for designing varied recovery protocols
Efficiency 8.5 — budget model appropriate for support role
"Budget Balanced" — 5-model merge provides well-rounded capabilities
Lower logic (5) matches intuitive, less analytical recovery role
Can suggest creative recovery modalities and stress management approaches
Warm, accessible tone fits "calm presence" persona

Quinn (Data Analyst/Watchdog)
Model: R1 Distill Llama 70B #132
Alternative: R1 Distill Qwen 32B #130

Logic 8.5 for rigorous feasibility analysis and constraint evaluation
[SELF-VERIFYING] tendency from R1 distillation catches unrealistic protocols
"Llama Ecosystem, Enterprise" — reliable for critical watchdog role
Efficiency 7.5 justified for critical role preventing generic advice
Strong at spotting diminishing returns and over-optimization
Analytical focus (low creativity: 4) matches data-driven persona
Larger 70B model handles complex constraint analysis
