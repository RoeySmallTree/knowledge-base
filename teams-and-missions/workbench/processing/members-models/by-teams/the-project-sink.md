Detailed Reasoning

Intake (Reception/Chair/Orchestrator)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

This is the CHAIR — the orchestrator who coordinates the entire dump-processing workflow
Creativity 5 + Logic 8 + Brain-tier 9 = needs solid all-around intelligence
30hr-endurance fits the "always-on sink" use case perfectly
Sonnet 4.5 is the production workhorse — reliable, consistent, never refuses messy input
"Format-agnostic" and "never-rejects" aligns with Sonnet's permissive nature
Long-running stability critical for maintaining project context across dumps
Production-grade reliability prevents failures when handling chaotic input
128K context holds project state while receiving new dumps

Classifier (Entity Extraction/Typing)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 9 requirement for entity extraction and type reasoning
"Competition-Math" trait applies to systematic categorization logic
Precise + Stepwise matches "can tell what something is within seconds"
Pure reasoning without tools — doesn't need external dependencies
Efficiency 5 acceptable for critical extraction quality
Handles complex extraction from messy, unstructured input
No-tools design means faster, more reliable classification
Can create new categories (organic taxonomy) through pure reasoning

Connector (Structure Building/Linking)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

Logic 9 + Memory 10 requirement for relationship reasoning and structure tracking
[SELF-VERIFYING] — critical for ensuring connections are valid
Visible-CoT shows exactly how relationships are being built
"Sees relationships before objects" matches R1's reasoning-first approach
Must hold entire project structure (Memory 10) — R1's context handles this
Creative 6 for finding non-obvious connections — R1's reasoning discovers these
Transparent thinking process lets user see why things are being linked
Self-correction prevents incorrect cross-references

Consolidator (Deduplication/Merging)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Logic 9 for equivalence reasoning and conflict reconciliation
Memory 10 requirement — must remember everything to spot duplicates
Efficiency 9.5 makes this affordable for high-volume dedup work
Structured-output perfect for generating clean merged entries
"Duplicate-radar" matches MiniMax's systematic analysis capabilities
Tool-seeking trait allows browser-control for verifying information
Self-correcting ensures merge decisions are sound
Multi-source synthesis aligns with merging scattered mentions

Archivist (Preservation/Quality/Logging)
Model: Trinity Mini #120
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 8 + Brain-tier 8 sufficient for quality assessment
Memory 9 tracks all absorbed content and dump history
Efficiency 9.5 — archival is support role, cost-optimize here
"Original-preserver" and "provenance-protector" need reliable logging
Structured output for maintaining dump log and audit trails
Precise trait ensures no information is lost during archiving
Fast-twitch for rapid quality checks without bottlenecking intake
Cost-saver tier appropriate for systematic archival work


Cost & Trait Analysis

CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (3): Intake, Classifier, Connector
├── High (2):     Consolidator, Archivist
└── Budget-optimized: Consolidator, Archivist

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [PRODUCTION-GRADE]   Intake     — 30hr endurance, never-reject reliability
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]   Classifier — Systematic entity extraction logic
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]     Connector  — Ensure valid relationships
├── [VISIBLE-COT]        Connector  — Transparent linking decisions
├── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT]  Consolidator, Archivist — Clean merges and logs
└── [MULTI-SOURCE-SYNTH] Consolidator — Merge scattered mentions

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium production:  Intake (#136)
├── Premium reasoning:   Classifier (#122), Connector (#128)
├── Cost-optimized:      Consolidator (#3), Archivist (#120)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), DeepSeek (2), MiniMax (1), SauceGoat (1)

ROLE COHERENCE:
├── Intake = Chair orchestrating chaos acceptance
├── Classifier = Analyst extracting structure from mess
├── Connector = Strategist building knowledge graph
├── Consolidator = Watchdog preventing fragmentation
└── Archivist = Guardian preserving provenance

CONTEXT REQUIREMENTS:
├── Connector (Memory 10): Must hold entire project structure
├── Consolidator (Memory 10): Must remember all content to spot dupes
├── Intake (Memory 9): Must maintain project context during dumps
├── Archivist (Memory 9): Must track absorption history
└── R1 (#128) 128K, Sonnet (#136) 128K, others sufficient

FALLBACK CHAIN INTEGRITY:
├── Intake:       #136 → #14 (both production-grade coordinators)
├── Classifier:   #122 → #3 (reasoning to balanced precision)
├── Connector:    #128 → #181 (R1 to QwQ reasoning chain)
├── Consolidator: #3 → #212 (MiniMax to Phi systematic)
└── Archivist:    #120 → #35 (Trinity to Nemotron efficiency)

WORKFLOW COHERENCE:
1. Intake receives chaos → Sonnet's permissive orchestration
2. Classifier extracts entities → Speciale's precise reasoning
3. Connector builds structure → R1's visible relationship logic
4. Consolidator merges dupes → MiniMax's multi-source synthesis
5. Archivist preserves provenance → Trinity's structured logging

COST OPTIMIZATION:
├── Splurge on Intake (always-on coordinator) ✓
├── Splurge on Classifier (quality determines everything) ✓
├── Splurge on Connector (structure IS the value) ✓
├── Optimize Consolidator (systematic, high-volume) ✓
└── Optimize Archivist (support role, reliable logging) ✓
