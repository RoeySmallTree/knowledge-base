"Most-Intelligent, Research-Grade" matches institutional-quality investment thesis writing
Creative 8.5 enables variant perception identification — the edge in hedge fund investing
Can synthesize macro, industry, financial, risk, valuation, and moat perspectives into coherent investment decision
"Deep-Thinker" trait supports multi-layer reasoning required for investment committee presentations
Web search capability allows verification and real-time market data integration
Multimodal support enables chart/table analysis from earnings presentations

Macro - Economic Context
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH] — Essential for Fed statements, economic data releases, treasury yield curves
[X-SEARCH] — Track real-time economic commentary and market sentiment
2M context allows tracking complex economic relationships over time
Logic 8.5 for interpreting economic data and connecting to company impact
"Analyst, Long-Horizon" traits match macro's long-cycle perspective
Can pull current rate environment, credit conditions, and geopolitical factors
Real-time capability critical — macro changes between research start and IC presentation

Industry - Competitive Landscaping
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — Critical for competitor filings, market reports, industry data
2M context tracks competitive landscape across multiple companies
Logic 8.5 for structured competitive analysis and TAM sizing
"Precise, Tool-Seeker, Fast-Twitch" matches rapid industry intelligence gathering
Can research competitors, size markets, assess positioning in real-time
Industry structure analysis requires current data — not training cutoff data
Creative 7.0 provides positioning insight beyond pure data aggregation

Financial - Modeling/Analysis
Model: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122
Alternative: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128

[COMPETITION-MATH] — Built for complex financial modeling without tools
Logic 10.0 for rigorous segment analysis, margin calculations, quality of earnings assessment
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" supports multi-step financial modeling

Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

[COMPETITION-MATH] — Built for DCF, peer comps, reverse DCF calculations
Logic 9.5 for rigorous multi-method valuation triangulation
Efficiency 9.0 — valuation is high-volume calculations, doesn't need premium compute
"Precise, Stepwise, Competition-Math" matches systematic valuation methodology
14B efficiency handles peer screening, multiple calculations, scenario modeling
Can derive targets, test reverse DCF implications, compare methodologies
Cost-effective for analytical role that complements (not leads) the research

Moat - Competitive Advantage
Model: Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

"User-Aligned, Non-Sycophantic" — Won't accept weak moat claims
