Detailed Reasoning

Compass (Session Lead/Synthesizer)
Model: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14
Alternative: Claude Opus 4.5 #135

Logic 10.0 + Creative 8.5 = balanced empathy and insight
[DEEP-THINK + MULTIMODAL] — can process complex life situations holistically
"Most-Intelligent, Deep-Thinker, Research-Grade" matches understanding-focused persona
Chair-tier model for the critical guiding role
2M context window tracks evolving life profiles across sessions
Can synthesize emotional nuance with practical understanding
Web search capability allows real-time research on specific life situations (mental health resources, local services, evidence-based approaches)
"The right question is worth more than ten answers" requires deep reasoning
Warm, present communication style matches Gemini's empathetic tuning

Pathfinder (Direction Specialist)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191

Creative 9.0 for expansive possibility exploration
[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — builds coherent life paths and future scenarios
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches dream validation and option generation
131K context for maintaining complex possibility spaces
Non-restrictive content allows exploring unconventional paths without judgment
"What if..." requires creative divergent thinking
Validates dreams without pre-filtering based on conventional wisdom
Designed for narrative coherence — can build realistic scenarios of different life paths
Can explore morally complex situations (career changes, relationship decisions) without lecture mode

Blueprint (Design/Planning Specialist)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2 #123
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 9.0 for systematic habit architecture and milestone planning
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable for detailed planning sessions
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic, Tool-Master" matches systematic planning persona
Long-horizon reasoning for multi-step life plans
Can design proper behavioral systems (cue-routine-reward)
"Start smaller than that" requires precise calibration and stepwise thinking
Open-source option for self-hosting sensitive life planning data
Handles complex constraint satisfaction (real life constraints + goals)
Strong at breaking large goals into achievable sub-tasks

Spark (Motivation Specialist)
Model: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216
Alternative: Lunaris 8B #215

Creative 9.0 for genuine, non-formulaic encouragement
Efficiency 8.5 — motivation role doesn't need premium compute
"Slop-free dataset" ensures authentic reframing, not canned positivity
Minimal refusals allows honest celebration without filtering
Budget model appropriate for supporting role
Can reframe without falling into toxic positivity patterns
Natural language generation quality for emotional resonance
"Wait, that's a win!" requires pattern recognition but not deep reasoning
Anti-corporate training avoids generic motivational speak

Root (Analysis/Pattern Specialist)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for pattern identification
Logic 9.0 finds underlying issues and behavioral patterns
Chain-of-thought visibility shows reasoning for "the real issue might be..."
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches analytical, honest persona
Can identify when professional help is needed through systematic assessment
Reality-check function requires rigorous logical analysis
Open reasoning lets team see Root's pattern detection process
Can ask uncomfortable questions with clear logical justification
Verifies assumptions in life analysis ("I'm noticing a pattern...")


Cost & Trait Analysis

CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (3): Compass, Blueprint, Root
├── High (1):     Pathfinder
└── Budget-optimized: Spark

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Compass      — Research mental health resources, local services
├── [DEEP-THINK]        Compass      — Complex life situation synthesis
├── [MULTIMODAL]        Compass      — Can process shared images (living spaces, journals, etc.)
├── [SPATIAL-AWARE]     Pathfinder   — Life path scenario building
├── [CHARACTER-CONSIST] Pathfinder   — Coherent possibility exploration
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Root         — Pattern validation, assumption checking
├── [VISIBLE-COT]       Root         — Transparent pattern analysis
└── [LONG-HORIZON]      Blueprint    — Multi-step life planning

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:  Compass (#14), Blueprint (#123), Root (#128)
├── Creative specialist: Pathfinder (#213)
└── Cost-optimized:     Spark (#216)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Google (1), Sao10K (1), DeepSeek (2), Lumimaid (1)

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC CONSIDERATIONS:

SENSITIVITY & PRIVACY:
- Life planning involves highly personal information
- Open-source options (DeepSeek, QwQ) allow self-hosting for privacy-conscious users
- No models with data retention concerns in critical roles

EMPATHY VS ANALYSIS BALANCE:
- Compass: High empathy + high reasoning
- Pathfinder: High creativity + moderate logic (exploration needs possibility)
- Blueprint: High logic + moderate creativity (planning needs structure)
- Spark: High creativity + lower logic (motivation needs authenticity over analysis)
- Root: High logic + low creativity (reality-checking needs objectivity)

ANTI-PATTERNS AVOIDED:
- No lecture-prone models (Venice, Hermes avoid preaching)
- No overly restrictive content policies (can discuss addiction, mental health openly)
- No generic corporate voice (Lumimaid's slop-free training)
- No purely analytical models in empathetic roles

COMPLEMENTARY DYNAMICS:
- Compass asks questions → Pathfinder explores options → Blueprint designs path → Spark maintains energy → Root validates reality
- Creative models (Pathfinder, Spark) balanced by logical models (Blueprint, Root)
- Chair model (Compass) synthesizes all perspectives
- Pattern detector (Root) catches what others miss

SESSION MEMORY REQUIREMENTS:
- All models 8+ Memory score except Spark (acceptable for motivation role)
- Long context in Compass (2M) and Pathfinder (131K) for evolving life profiles
- Blueprint and Root have strong reasoning memory for pattern tracking

FALLBACK STRATEGY:
- Compass fallback to Claude Opus 4.5 (#135) maintains chair-tier quality
- Pathfinder fallback to Hermes 4 (#191) keeps non-restrictive creativity
- Blueprint fallback to MiniMax (#3) maintains tool-using, structured output
- Root fallback to QwQ-32B (#181) maintains reasoning at lower cost
- Spark fallback to Lunaris (#215) maintains creative warmth

COST OPTIMIZATION NOTES:
- Only 3 premium models (Compass, Blueprint, Root) — appropriate for critical roles
- Spark deliberately budget model — motivation doesn't need SOTA reasoning
- Pathfinder mid-tier creative specialist — exploration needs quality but not flagship
- Total team cost balanced: 2 flagship + 1 specialist + 1 budget + 1 efficient reasoning
