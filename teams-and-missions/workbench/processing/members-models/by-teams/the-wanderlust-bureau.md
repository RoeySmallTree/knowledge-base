└── Ultra-efficient:    Ledger (#35)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
xAI (4), NVIDIA (1)

SEARCH CAPABILITY JUSTIFICATION:
This team is COMPLETELY DEPENDENT on web search. Every role except Ledger requires real-time access to:
- Flight booking sites (Kayak, Google Flights, airline sites)
- Hotel booking platforms (Booking.com, Hotels.com, Airbnb)
- Restaurant databases (Yelp, OpenTable, Google Maps, TripAdvisor)
- Attraction information (official sites, ticket vendors, accessibility data)
- Current pricing, availability, hours, and booking links

The Grok 4.1/4 Fast family is the OPTIMAL choice because:
1. Native web search capability built-in
2. High efficiency (9.5) enables extensive research within budget
3. 2M context allows tracking of complex multi-day itineraries
4. Fast execution for interactive planning sessions
5. Can access both general web and X/Twitter for real-time intel

MODEL REUSE STRATEGY:
Scout, Logistics, and Palate all use Grok 4 Fast (#139) because:
- All three are research-heavy roles with similar requirements
- Web search is non-negotiable for all three
- They operate in parallel (destinations + flights + restaurants)
- Efficiency 9.5 makes repeated use sustainable
- No conflicts — they research different domains
- Alternative (DeepResearch 30B) provides fallback with same capabilities
