Alternative (#170) provides pure coding focus if Cog needs to model systems

Drift (Sociologist/Culture)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

[SPATIAL-AWARE] trait perfect for mapping social structures and environments
[CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] maintains cultural continuity across timeline
131K context tracks social evolution through multiple eras
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches "ordinary people" focused persona
Non-restrictive content allows exploration of morally complex social scenarios
Excellent at extrapolating how technology changes social relations

Atlas (Strategist/Geopolitics)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 9.0 for rigorous geopolitical analysis
Efficiency 10 — Cost-effective for analytical (not creative) strategic role
"Precise, Stepwise, Fast-Twitch" matches cold analytical persona
Hybrid architecture handles complex power dynamic calculations
3.2B active params sufficient for strategic reasoning without premium costs
Can trace alliance structures and war contingencies systematically

Quill (Archivist/Forger)
Model: Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216

Creative 7.5+ (actually 8.0) — Strong creative writing for period documents
"User-aligned, Anti-lecture" enables authentic voice mimicry without refusals
Creative 8.0 sufficient for convincing fake newspapers, letters, decrees
Can mimic different eras' communication styles without moralizing
Alternative (#216) provides budget creative option with "slop-free dataset"
Both models handle period-appropriate language and format fabrication
Non-restrictive allows historically accurate content (wars, propaganda, etc.)

Vex (Consistency Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

Logic 9.0 — CRITICAL for catching contradictions and paradoxes
[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — Perfect for consistency checking
Chain-of-thought visibility shows exactly what's being validated
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches contradiction-allergic persona
Can track complex branching implications across entire timeline
Memory 9/10 requirement met through reasoning trace architecture
Open reasoning allows Epoch to see Vex's analysis process
Alternative (#181) provides 1/20th size budget option with similar reasoning

├── [SPATIAL-AWARE]     Drift — Social structure mapping
├── [CHARACTER-CONSIST] Drift — Cultural continuity across timeline
└── [ANTI-LECTURE]      Quill — Authentic historical voice without moralizing

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium flagship:    Epoch (#14)
├── Premium reasoning:   Cog (#123), Vex (#128)
├── Creative specialists: Drift (#213), Quill (#191)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Google (1), DeepSeek (2), Sao10K (1), NVIDIA (1), Nous Research (1)

ROLE-SPECIFIC OPTIMIZATION:

Chair Role (Epoch):
- Chose #14 over #135/40 because historical research requires breadth + web search
- Deep research mode superior to pure reasoning for alternate history synthesis
- Multimodal critical for timeline visualization and map coordination

Technical Specialist (Cog):
- DeepSeek V3 chosen for engineering reasoning vs pure coding focus
- Alternative #170 (Qwen Coder) if implementation > design needed
- Efficiency 9.5 appropriate since Cog is consultative, not always-on

Creative Roles (Drift/Quill):
- Both use permissive models for historically authentic content
- Euryale's spatial awareness (#213) perfect for sociologist mapping
- Hermes 4's anti-lecture (#191) enables period voice mimicry
- Budget alternatives (#216) available if cost becomes concern

Watchdog (Vex):
- R1's visible reasoning superior to black-box consistency checking
- Self-correcting trait catches timeline contradictions automatically
- Memory requirement met through reasoning architecture vs raw context

Strategic Analysis (Atlas):
- Ultra-efficient #35 appropriate for analytical (not creative) role
- Logic 9.0 sufficient for geopolitical cascade tracking
- Cost-optimization here funds premium models for Epoch/Vex/Drift


Team Dynamics & Model Synergy

WORKFLOW PATTERN:
1. Epoch (Gemini 3 Pro) anchors divergence point with historical research
2. Cog (V3.2) analyzes technical feasibility and development pathways
3. Drift (Euryale) maps social/cultural evolution through spatial reasoning
4. Atlas (Nemotron) traces geopolitical consequences with cold logic
5. Quill (Hermes 4) fabricates convincing period documents in authentic voices
6. Vex (R1) validates entire timeline for consistency with visible reasoning

CROSS-MEMBER SYNERGY:
- Epoch's web search feeds accurate historical anchors to all specialists
- Vex's visible CoT lets Epoch see exactly which assumptions are challenged
- Drift's spatial mapping complements Atlas's power structure analysis
- Quill's period documents make abstract timeline elements tangible
- Cog's bottleneck identification constrains Atlas's strategic possibilities

COST-QUALITY BALANCE:
- 50% of team on premium models (Epoch, Cog, Vex, Drift, Quill) = quality outputs
- 17% ultra-efficient (Atlas) = strategic cost management
- Total configuration balances rigor (Logic 8-10) with creativity (5-9)

FAILURE MODES ADDRESSED:
- Handwaving tech: Cog (#123) with Logic 9.0 forces plausibility
- Timeline contradictions: Vex (#128) catches with self-verifying reasoning
- Wild speculation: Epoch (#14) anchors with research-grade fact-checking
- Anachronistic voices: Quill (#191) provides period-authentic anti-lecture mode
- Abstract history: Drift (#213) grounds in ordinary people's daily life
