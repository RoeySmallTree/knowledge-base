Detailed Reasoning

Quill (Publisher/Chair)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 8.5 + Creative 8.0 — editorial requires both analytical matching and creative sensibility
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Tool-Seeker, Self-Correcting" fits publisher's quality control role
Efficiency 9.5 — cost-effective for coordinative role that runs frequently
STRUCTURED-OUTPUT capability perfect for packaging final deliverables professionally
Browser control could format rich output with stylistic annotations
Manages multiple creative voices without needing to BE creative itself


Bard (Shakespeare Voice)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: MythoMax L2 13B #219

Creative 9.0 — essential for channeling Shakespeare's linguistic virtuosity
[SPATIAL-AWARE + CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — critical for maintaining Elizabethan worldview and voice consistency
"Immersive, World-Builder, Storyteller" matches theatrical, stage-worthy persona
131K context maintains complex metaphor chains and five-act structure across longer pieces
Non-restrictive allows period-appropriate language without modern sanitization
High brain-tier (creative capacity) supports iambic pentameter and extended metaphor construction


Ernest (Hemingway Voice)
Model: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216
Alternative: Lunaris 8B #215

Creative 9.0 with Efficiency 8.5 — creative minimalism doesn't need premium compute
"Slop-free dataset" critical for Hemingway's stripped, clean prose style
Budget-friendly for a voice that philosophically rejects excess
"Roleplayer, Permissive, Colloquial" fits the understated, masculine, no-nonsense persona
Lower memory needs (5) align with "each sentence stands alone" requirement
Smaller model reinforces the iceberg theory — lean, efficient, economical


Howard (Lovecraft Voice)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

Creative 9.0 — cosmic horror requires high creative capacity
[SPATIAL-AWARE] — essential for building otherworldly environments and eldritch geometry
"World-Builder, Immersive, Storyteller" matches construction of horrific realities
131K context supports extended purple prose and escalating dread maintenance
Non-restrictive content policy allows full Lovecraftian vocabulary and themes
"Character-Consistent" ensures the consistently unreliable narrator voice


Jane (Austen Voice)
Model: Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.2 #214

Creative 7.5 + Logic 7.5 — Austen's wit requires balanced creative and structural intelligence
"User-Aligned, Non-Sycophantic, Steerable" — irony demands sophisticated non-literal communication
ANTI-LECTURE trait perfect for Austen's "show don't tell" social observation
"Transparent-Thinker" supports free indirect discourse and layered meaning
Uncensored allows period-appropriate class/marriage observations without modern filtering
Strong at saying devastating things elegantly — core Austen competency


Fyodor (Dostoyevsky Voice)
Model: Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Creative 7.5 + Logic 7.5 — philosophical tangents require both creativity and logical argument structure
"Transparent-Thinker" — Dostoyevsky's style IS visible internal reasoning and confession
ANTI-LECTURE while maintaining philosophical depth — explores ideas without preaching
"User-Aligned, Non-Sycophantic" — addresses reader directly with searching questions
Uncensored allows full exploration of psychological torment and moral ambiguity
Can track complex nested arguments ("arguments within arguments") required for this voice


Edgar (Poe Voice)
Model: MythoMax L2 13B #219
Alternative: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216

Creative 9.5 — highest creative score for Poe's macabre imagination and poetic rhythm
"Most popular RP model" — proven track record for maintaining obsessive, unreliable narrator voices
Permissive content policy for death, madness, and Gothic horror themes
Strong at character coherence for maintaining the obsessed, deteriorating narrator
Budget-efficient for high-volume creative work
Poetic rhythm construction benefits from model's narrative flow strengths


Vera (Plagiarism Checker)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Logic 8.5 — critical for evaluating similarity and legal risk
"Production-Grade, Self-Correcting" — cannot afford errors in IP analysis
30hr-endurance supports checking multiple drafts across extended sessions
128K context can compare drafts against extensive source material simultaneously
STRUCTURED-THINKING supports systematic similarity analysis and risk assessment
Premium model justified — getting sued is expensive, Vera prevents that

VOICE ARCHETYPE MAPPING:
├── Grand/Theatrical:     Bard (Shakespeare) — High creative, spatial, immersive
├── Minimalist:           Ernest (Hemingway) — Efficient, slop-free, disciplined
├── Cosmic Horror:        Howard (Lovecraft) — World-builder, spatial, permissive
├── Social Wit:           Jane (Austen) — Balanced, anti-lecture, transparent
├── Philosophical Torment: Fyodor (Dostoyevsky) — Transparent-thinker, uncensored
├── Gothic Obsession:     Edgar (Poe) — Maximum creative, narrative flow
└── Quality Control:      Vera (Checker) — Logic-first, production-grade

CREATIVE SPECTRUM:
├── Highest (9.0-9.5): Bard, Howard, Edgar — Require maximum creative capacity
├── High (7.5-8.0):    Jane, Fyodor — Creative + structural balance
├── Efficient (9.0):   Ernest — Creative minimalism
└── Analytical (8.5):  Quill, Vera — Logic-forward roles

ASSIGNMENT PHILOSOPHY:
1. Match creative capacity to voice ambition (Bard/Howard/Edgar get premium creative)
2. Use budget models where style IS constraint (Ernest's minimalism = small model)
3. Leverage uncensored/anti-lecture for period authenticity (no modern filtering)
4. Invest in quality control (Vera) to protect the entire operation
5. Balance creative diversity with cost efficiency (mix of tiers)

COST JUSTIFICATION:
- Premium models (Euryale, Hermes) for voices requiring sustained worldview (Shakespeare, Lovecraft, Austen, Dostoyevsky)
- Budget creative (Lumimaid, MythoMax) for constrained/focused voices (Hemingway, Poe)
- Standard coordinator (MiniMax) — doesn't need to BE creative, manages creatives
- Production-grade checker (Sonnet) — IP mistakes are more expensive than the model

TEAM SYNERGY:
- Quill assigns voices based on content type → Needs editorial intelligence
- Writers operate independently → No inter-model coordination needed
- Vera reviews ALL outputs → Must handle high volume with perfect accuracy
- No sequential dependencies → All voices can run in parallel
- Publisher packages final output → Structured output critical

MODEL REUSE NOTES:
- Euryale #213 used for both Bard AND Howard (different creative directions, both need world-building)
- Hermes #191 used for both Jane AND Fyodor (both need transparent thinking + balance)
- This is acceptable — roles don't interact, creative application differs significantly
- Cost savings allow premium checker (Vera) investment

ALTERNATIVE STRATEGY:
If budget extremely constrained:
- Consolidate Bard/Howard/Jane/Fyodor into single premium creative (#213 or #191)
- Use MythoMax #219 for all voices (proven RP generalist)
- Risk: Less voice distinctiveness, more generic "literary voice"
- Current assignment prioritizes quality and authentic voice recreation
