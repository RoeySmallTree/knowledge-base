Detailed Reasoning
Vector (Paranoiac/Narrative Driver)
Model: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Logic 7.5 handles internal conspiracy logic (doesn't need real logic, needs plausible logic)
Creative 7.5 for finding creative connections and building elaborate narratives
"User-Aligned, Non-Sycophantic, Steerable" matches the true-believer persona
Anti-lecture trait perfect for paranoid energy without pushback
Uncensored allows morally gray conspiracy theorizing
70B parameter model provides narrative coherence across escalating revelations
Can maintain the "intensity increases as connections multiply" dynamic
Strong at pacing revelations for maximum dramatic impact

Cobweb (Archivist/Research)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH] — Critical for finding real historical facts
[X-SEARCH] — Can pull obscure historical events and timeline data
Logic 8.5 for finding logical historical connections
2M context tracks complex historical timelines and cross-references
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches academic research persona
Real-time search provides genuinely obscure, verifiable facts
Makes conspiracy "terrifyingly plausible" by grounding in documented truth
Can pull real dates, events, and correlations that anchor the theory

Cipher (Numerologist/Pattern Finder)
Model: QwQ-32B #181
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 9.0 for actual gematria calculations and date correlations
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Stepwise" matches compulsive calculator persona
Self-correcting ensures calculations are internally consistent
Creative 5.0 appropriate — finds patterns in real numbers, not inventing
32.5B params efficient for computational role that doesn't need creativity
Can generate elaborate mathematical connections that "prove" correlations
Strong at numerical manipulation and pattern recognition
Makes skeptics pause with "the numbers don't lie" precision

Glyph (Symbologist/Visual Decoder)
Model: InternVL3 78B #189
Alternative: GLM-4.6V #6

[VISION CAPABILITY] — Essential for analyzing logos, imagery, symbols
Creative 8.0 for finding creative visual connections
Logic 8.5 for grounding analysis in legitimate design principles
Multimodal master can process images if user provides them
Can analyze color choices, corporate logos, symbolic imagery
"Visually obsessed" persona needs actual visual processing capability
Knows both legitimate symbolism AND conspiratorial interpretations
Makes "they're not even hiding it" analysis more credible

Quill (Skeptic/Convert)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 8.5 for raising genuine, rational objections
Creative 8.0 not needed — reactive role, not generative
"Precise, Deep-Thinker" for critical thinking skills
Self-Correcting trait mirrors the conversion arc (objections weaken)
Efficiency 9.5 appropriate for supporting role
Can recognize when their own objections are being overwhelmed
The gradual conversion validates the conspiracy theory
Represents "mainstream" thinking before accepting the evidence

Redact (Whistleblower/Assembler)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Efficiency 9.5 for supporting assembly/packaging role
Logic 8.5 for organizing all evidence into coherent deliverables
Creative 8.0 sufficient for manifesto-style writing
"Precise, Self-Correcting" ensures manifesto is internally consistent
Browser control could format elaborate "Red String Board" documents
Memory not critical — compiles what others have already established
Creates urgency and "leaked document" aesthetic
Treats deliverable as sacred document that must be distributed


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (2): Vector, Cobweb
├── High (4):     Cipher, Glyph, Quill, Redact
└── Budget-optimized: Cipher, Quill, Redact

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Cobweb  — Real historical fact verification
├── [X-SEARCH]          Cobweb  — Obscure timeline data, social context
├── [VISION]            Glyph   — Logo/symbol/imagery analysis
├── [UNCENSORED]        Vector  — Morally gray conspiracy theorizing
├── [SELF-CORRECTING]   Cipher  — Mathematical consistency
└── [ANTI-LECTURE]      Vector  — Paranoid energy without pushback

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Creative lead:      Vector (#191)
├── Search-enabled:     Cobweb (#138)
├── Reasoning support:  Cipher (#181)
├── Vision specialist:  Glyph (#189)
└── Cost-optimized:     Quill (#3), Redact (#3)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
NousResearch (1), xAI (1), Alibaba (1), OpenGVLab (1), MiniMax (2)

ROLE DYNAMICS:
├── Vector builds narrative momentum with creative connections
├── Cobweb anchors with real historical facts (web search critical)
├── Cipher provides "proof" layer with numerical correlations
├── Glyph adds "they're telling us" visual evidence
├── Quill validates through conversion arc (skeptic → believer)
└── Redact packages into Red String Board + Manifesto deliverable

COMEDY MECHANISM:
The team's effectiveness comes from the tension between:
- Real facts (Cobweb's web search) making absurdity plausible
- Precise calculations (Cipher) lending false credibility
- Visual analysis (Glyph) finding "meaning" in coincidence
- Skeptic conversion (Quill) validating the escalating madness
- Vector's paranoid energy escalating from plausible to absurd

ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Vector alt: Euryale #213 (spatial-aware for mapping connections)
- Cobweb alt: DeepResearch #188 (multi-source synthesis at lower cost)
- Cipher alt: Nemotron #35 (precise calculations, ultra-efficient)
- Glyph alt: GLM-4.6V #6 (vision + tool-calling, more efficient)
- Quill/Redact share model (both supporting roles, non-concurrent)
