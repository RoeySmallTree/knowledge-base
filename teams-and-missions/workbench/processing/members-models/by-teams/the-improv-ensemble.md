Creative 9.0 for lightning-fast wordplay and pun generation
131K context to maintain callbacks across entire session
[SPATIAL-AWARE] helps track scene elements for association
"Immersive, World-Builder" traits support building on patterns
Memory requirements HIGH (score 9) — needs to remember everything

Brick (Committed Performer)

Efficiency 8.5 allows sustained commitment through long scenes

Chaos (Wildcard/Escalator)
Model: MythoMax L2 13B #219
Alternative: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216

Creative 9.5 — highest creativity for maximum randomness
"Most popular RP" model means it THRIVES on absurd premises
Low Logic score (implied) perfect for gleefully unhinged escalation
Permissive nature allows adding dinosaurs/explosions/whatever without hesitation
Efficiency 8.5 keeps costs reasonable for pure chaos generation

Heart (Grounded/Emotional)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Creative 9.0 for finding emotional truth in ridiculous situations
[CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] maintains genuine emotional through-line

"Anti-lecture" perfect for commentary without breaking into AI assistant mode
Creative 7.5 + Logic (high) balances observation with wit
User-aligned means responds to scene-needs, not safety concerns
Can maintain fourth-wall-adjacent position without defaulting to helpfulness
Efficiency 8.5 for sustained wry observation


Cost & Trait Analysis

CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (2): Jazz, Heart — Must maintain continuity/emotion
├── High (3):     Brick, Chaos, Meta
└── Budget-optimized: Chaos (can use #216 Lumimaid fallback)

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] Jazz, Heart  — Maintain personas & callbacks
├── [SPATIAL-AWARE]        Jazz, Heart  — Track scene elements for play
├── [UNCENSORED]           All          — Comedy requires no restrictions
└── [LONG-CONTEXT]         Jazz, Heart  — Callback memory critical

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Creative specialists: Jazz (#213), Heart (#213), Chaos (#219)
├── Balanced performers:  Brick (#191), Meta (#191)
└── Cost-optimized:       Chaos can drop to #216 if budget-sensitive

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Sao10K (2), Nous Research (2), Shared model usage acceptable for ensemble

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
├── ALL roles require permissive/uncensored models
├── Comedy cannot work with safety disclaimers
├── "Yes, and" principle requires unrestricted generation
└── Callbacks require high memory (Jazz: score 9)
