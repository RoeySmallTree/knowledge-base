- Regulations (multi-jurisdiction)
- Precedents (case law references)
- Compliance status (repository-wide tracking)
Long context models (#138 with 2M) and efficient context use (#14, #3) prioritized

RESEARCH CAPABILITIES:
├── Counsel: Deep research via Gemini 3 Pro's research-grade capabilities
├── Monitor: Real-time monitoring via Grok 4.1 Fast's dual search
└── Advocate: Counter-precedent research via web search when needed

COST PROFILE:
Mission-critical legal analysis (Counsel) gets premium model
Continuous monitoring (Monitor) gets efficient search-enabled model
Supporting roles (Clerk, Compliance) share cost-effective systematic model
Challenge role (Advocate) uses mid-tier uncensored model
Total: Balanced cost structure with quality where it matters most
