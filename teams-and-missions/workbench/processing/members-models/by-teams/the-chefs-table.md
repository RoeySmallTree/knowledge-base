Anti-lecture tone fits "Let's see what we're working with" pragmatism
[WEB-SEARCH] for recipe research and menu inspiration
Can coordinate team effectively without heavy compute cost
Treats constraints as creative challenges, not roadblocks

Larder (Pantry Manager/Inventory/Constraints)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 8.5 for precise constraint tracking and substitution logic
Efficiency 9.5—analytical role doesn't need premium compute
[STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] perfect for ingredient lists, constraint matrices
[BROWSER-CONTROL] could manage inventory databases
"Precise, Self-Correcting" matches obsessive inventory accuracy
Native multi-source synthesis for dietary restriction implications
Can verify against master lists and flag violations systematically
Cost-saver for support role that runs frequently

Saucier (Technique Expert/Recipe Development)
Model: Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213

Creative 7.5 for recipe development and technique adaptation
Logic 7.5 for explaining technique reasoning and troubleshooting
"Transparent-Thinker" matches explaining the "why" behind techniques
User-aligned—explains techniques in accessible ways
Can adapt fine dining techniques to home kitchens
[WEB-SEARCH] for technique research and recipe testing
Non-restrictive allows full range of culinary techniques
Balance of creativity and logic fits the role perfectly

Savant (Historian/Culinary History/Context)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] critical for culinary history research
Can find famous chef quotes, restaurant versions, dish origins
2M context tracks complex culinary lineages and evolution
Logic 8.5 organizes historical information coherently
"Analyst" persona fits research-focused enrichment role
Real-time search catches current restaurant trends and chef news
Efficiency 9.5 reasonable for Medium importance enrichment role
Can connect any dish to its cultural and historical context

Clock (Expeditor/Timing/Coordination)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Logic 9.0 for precise timeline coordination and parallel sequencing
Efficiency 10—practical timing role doesn't need premium compute
"Precise, Stepwise" matches timeline-building methodology
Hybrid architecture handles complex timing constraint reasoning
Fast-twitch for quick timeline adjustments and coordination
Cost-effective for High importance but analytical support role
3.2B active params sufficient for timeline logic
Can optimize cooking sequences and identify critical moments

Check (Auditor/Verification/Compliance)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] perfect for systematic verification
Logic 9.0 for rigorous constraint checking and violation detection
Chain-of-thought transparency shows exact verification process
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches catching oversights
Critical role preventing recipe failures deserves quality reasoning
Can verify complex menus against multiple constraint dimensions
Open reasoning lets team see what's being verified
Prevents disasters by finding violations before cooking starts


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (4): Blanc, Larder, Saucier, Check
├── High (2):     Clock, Savant
└── Medium (1):   Savant (enrichment)

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Blanc, Saucier, Savant — Recipe research, techniques, history
├── [X-SEARCH]          Savant               — Chef news, restaurant trends
├── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Larder               — Ingredient lists, constraint tracking
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Check                — Systematic verification, violation detection
├── [BROWSER-CONTROL]   Larder               — Inventory database management
└── [VISIBLE-COT]       Check                — Transparent verification process

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium creative:   Blanc (#191), Saucier (#191)
├── Search-enabled:     Savant (#138)
├── Reasoning specialist: Check (#128)
└── Cost-optimized:     Larder (#3), Clock (#35)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
NousResearch (2), MiniMax (1), xAI (1), NVIDIA (1), DeepSeek (1)

ROLE SPECIALIZATION:
├── Creative Leads:     Blanc, Saucier — Menu design, recipe development
├── Analytical Support: Larder, Clock — Tracking, timing, coordination
├── Quality Assurance:  Check — Verification, compliance
└── Enrichment:         Savant — Context, history, culture

COST OPTIMIZATION:
- Two critical creative roles (Blanc, Saucier) share same efficient model (#191)
- Analytical support uses cost-savers (#3, #35)
- Research role uses search-capable but efficient model (#138)
- Watchdog role uses quality reasoning (#128) appropriate to criticality
- Total: 6 members with balanced cost profile

TEAM DYNAMICS:
- Blanc coordinates creative vision with practical constraints
- Larder enforces hard boundaries (inventory, restrictions)
- Saucier provides technique expertise and troubleshooting
- Savant enriches with context and cultural significance
- Clock orchestrates timing to ensure success
- Check prevents failure through systematic verification
- Balance of creativity (menu/recipes) and precision (inventory/timing/verification)
