TEAM DYNAMICS:
The War Room balances consulting rigor (Vector, Scope, Model) with board-level perspective (Titan, Operator, Sage). The analysts ground strategy in data while the archetypes pressure-test from different philosophical angles. Every recommendation emerges from analytical work validated by multiple strategic lenses.

Vector synthesizes inputs and manages the process. Scope ensures operational reality. Model validates with numbers. Intel provides market truth. Risk builds fallbacks. Then the Board debates: Titan pushes bold, Operator demands executable, Sage tests assumptions. The result: strategies that are both visionary and grounded, ambitious and realistic, backed by data and stress-tested from multiple angles.
