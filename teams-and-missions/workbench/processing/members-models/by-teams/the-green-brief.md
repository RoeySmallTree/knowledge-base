Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (3): Terra, Carb, Proof
├── High (3):     Leaf, Rule, Loop
└── Budget-optimized: None (compliance-heavy domain)

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Leaf, Rule  — Materials research, regulatory tracking
├── [X-SEARCH]          Leaf        — Supply chain intelligence
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Carb        — Rigorous LCA calculations
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Proof       — Claims verification, greenwash prevention
├── [SPATIAL-AWARE]     Loop        — Systems thinking, circular design
└── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Terra       — Professional deliverables assembly

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:   Carb (#122), Proof (#128)
├── Production workhorse: Terra (#136)
├── Search-enabled:      Leaf (#138), Rule (#138)
└── Creative specialist: Loop (#213)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), DeepSeek (2), xAI (2 roles), Sao10K (1)

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC RATIONALE:

ESG/Sustainability is a HIGH-STAKES domain where greenwashing litigation is real.
Regulatory scrutiny is increasing exponentially (EU CSRD, SEC climate rules, etc.).
Every claim must be defensible to regulators, investors, activists, and auditors.
This team composition reflects:
  ├── NO budget models in critical paths
  ├── Search-enabled for regulatory currency
  ├── Competition-grade math for LCA rigor
  └── Self-verifying watchdog prevents reputation damage

The cost premium is justified by litigation/reputation risk.
