TEAM DYNAMICS:
This team prioritizes CREATIVE voices with REAL-TIME DATA access. Madison's search capability is essential — the team can't function on outdated info. Derek is intentionally the wildcard spice role. Tiffany and Becca both use Hermes 4 but serve opposite functions (confident vs. soft), which the model's steerability supports.
