Detailed Reasoning
Receiver (Intake/Triage/Routing)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: MiniMax M2.1 #3

Critical role — friction kills capture systems
Logic 8.5 + Creative 8.5 for interpreting messy/minimal input
"Understands intent from minimal input" matches "always accepts"
30hr endurance for continuous availability as personal memory system
Production-grade reliability crucial for trust in capture
128K context maintains full session history for routing decisions

Classifier (Type ID/Extraction)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Logic 8.5 for complex type identification and extraction
Efficiency 9.5 — runs frequently on every input
Structured output capability perfect for extraction tasks
"Precise, Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches systematic classification
Multi-source synthesis handles compound items (todo + event + commitment)
Browser control potential for future calendar/external integrations

Organizer (Structure/Connections)
Model: Llama 4 Scout #203
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Memory 10 requirement — must hold ENTIRE knowledge base
10M context window handles complete personal knowledge graph
Efficiency 10.0 — runs continuously maintaining organization
"Navigator, Memory-Master" matches constant structural awareness
Long-context champion for relationship tracking across all stored items
Cost-effective for always-on background role

Gatherer (Query/Data Collection)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — Critical for contextual queries
"Can I take vacation?" needs real-time calendar, email, commitment data
Logic 8.5 for multi-domain relevance reasoning
2M context for comprehensive gathering across entire knowledge base
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst, Long-Horizon" matches methodical collection
Can pull external data when needed (flights, weather, etc.)

Synthesizer (Analysis/Recommendations)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2 #123
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Brain-tier 10 requirement for complex synthesis
Logic 9.0 for implication analysis and conflict detection
"Deep-Thinker, Agentic" matches "sees the story data tells"
Creative 7.5 for generating non-obvious insights
Long-Horizon trait for multi-step reasoning about consequences
Efficiency 9.5 keeps costs reasonable despite critical role

Monitor (Deadlines/Alerts)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

Efficiency 10 — runs continuously in background
Logic 9.0 for urgency calculation and timing decisions
Memory 10 (via context) must track all items with deadlines
"Precise, Stepwise, Fast-Twitch" matches systematic monitoring
Hybrid architecture handles temporal reasoning efficiently
Cost-effective for always-on watchdog role
