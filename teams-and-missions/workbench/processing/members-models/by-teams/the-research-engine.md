ROLE-MODEL REASONING:

Archivist: Memory Maximalist
The Archivist isn't just storing papers — it's maintaining a queryable graph of the entire literature corpus. Every claim, every citation relationship, every methodological choice must be instantly retrievable. Llama 4 Scout's 10M context window is purpose-built for this. At Memory: 10, it can literally hold hundreds of paper summaries, all their claims, all their relationships, and still have room for new additions. The Navigator trait means it can traverse this corpus efficiently. Web search capability is critical — half the job is finding papers the researcher doesn't know exist yet, verifying citations are accurate, and checking for retractions. No other model offers this memory capacity at efficiency 10.

Analyst: Structure Extraction Specialist
Extracting structured intelligence from academic papers requires understanding complex arguments, recognizing methodological choices, and mapping relationships between claims. DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale's IMO/IOI gold performance means it understands formal structures — exactly what's needed to extract "findings, methodology, limitations" from dense academic prose. Logic 10 handles the "must reason about relationships" requirement. The "never misses a key finding" mandate demands precision — and Speciale's competition-grade reasoning ensures no claim slips through. Pure reasoning strength (no tools needed) keeps the extraction process focused.

Critic: Adversarial Reasoning Engine
Detecting contradictions between papers requires holding multiple claims in mind simultaneously and reasoning precisely about logical conflicts. DeepSeek R1's visible chain-of-thought is perfect for this — the Theorist and Archivist can see exactly why the Critic believes Paper A contradicts Paper B. Self-verifying prevents false positives (claiming contradictions that don't exist). The "what-if obsessed" persona maps directly to "But Paper X says the opposite." Memory 9 allows holding all claims to detect conflicts. Adversarial reasoning is R1's core strength — this is exactly what it was designed for.

Theorist: Evolution Tracker
Tracking hypothesis evolution requires both logical rigor (how does this evidence affect the argument?) and creative flexibility (what alternative framings exist?). Sonnet 4.5's balanced Logic 8.5 / Creative 7.5 profile matches perfectly. The Long-Running trait is critical — thesis evolution happens over weeks or months of research. 30-hour endurance means it can maintain context across extended sessions. Structured-Thinking supports theoretical integration. Production-grade reliability ensures version history and rationale are never lost. This role needs steady, reliable intelligence over time — Sonnet delivers.

Scribe: Synthesis Craftsperson
Writing synthesis documents requires logic (structure arguments, ensure coherence) and creativity (engaging prose, clear explanations). MiniMax M2.1's Logic 8.5 / Creative 8.0 balance exceeds the Logic 8 / Creative 7 requirement. Structured output is critical for citation management — generating BibTeX, APA, Chicago formats correctly. Browser control enables formatting rich documents. Self-Correcting catches unsupported claims before they leave the system. Efficiency 9.5 makes it sustainable for frequent synthesis generation. The "clarity-obsessed, citation-guardian" persona maps perfectly to MiniMax's precise, quality-focused output.

WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:

1. Intake: Archivist receives paper → extracts to corpus → makes queryable
2. Extraction: Analyst processes paper → structures findings/methodology/limitations
3. Relationship Mapping: Analyst identifies connections to existing papers
4. Challenge: Critic scans for contradictions with existing corpus
5. Thesis Update: Theorist evaluates impact on hypothesis → updates version history
6. Synthesis: Scribe generates literature review / methodology comparison / evidence summary
7. Citation Management: Scribe maintains master bibliography → ensures attribution

The team is optimized for long-horizon research projects where corpus size grows over time. Archivist's 10M context scales with the literature. Critic prevents confirmation bias. Theorist ensures intellectual honesty. Scribe maintains output quality.

COST OPTIMIZATION:

Critical roles (Archivist, Analyst, Critic) get premium capabilities:
- Archivist: Unmatched memory at ultra-efficiency
- Analyst: Competition-grade extraction logic
- Critic: Self-verifying adversarial reasoning

High-importance roles (Theorist, Scribe) get production-grade balance:
- Theorist: Long-running reliable intelligence
- Scribe: Efficient structured synthesis

Total spend is moderate — two ultra-efficient models (#203, #3) offset premium reasoning (#122, #128). Theorist (#136) is mid-efficiency but justified by long-running requirement.

FALLBACK CHAIN RESILIENCE:

Archivist: #203 → #138 (both have search + long context)
Analyst: #122 → #169 (both competition-grade reasoning)
Critic: #128 → #181 (both self-verifying, open reasoning)
Theorist: #136 → #14 (both balanced logic+creative, research-grade)
Scribe: #3 → #35 (both efficient, precise, structured output)

No three-cycles. Provider diversity maintained. Each fallback preserves core capability.
