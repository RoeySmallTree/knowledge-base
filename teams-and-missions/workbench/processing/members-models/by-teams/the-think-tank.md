Detailed Reasoning
Kit (Creative Director/Chair)
Model: Claude Opus 4.5 #135
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Logic 9.5 handles complex facilitation across diverse thinker inputs
"Agentic, Computer-Use, Deep-Thinker" matches orchestration of chaotic ideation
Creative 8.5 required to recognize creative potential and synthesize across ideas
Must track multiple threads simultaneously (Brain-tier 10, Memory via long context)
Chair role demands premium quality — this is a Critical function
Sonnet 4.5 considered but Opus needed for synthesis complexity and judgment calls
Can manage the "diverge → evaluate → develop → synthesize" process flow

Zara (Unconventional Ideator)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Lumimaid v0.2 8B #216

Creative 9.0 — core function is generating unconventional ideas
[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] supports maintaining irreverent persona
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches ability to reframe entire problem spaces
Non-restrictive content policy allows contrarian "burn it down" ideas
131K context maintains thread of earlier challenges and build-ons
Logic 6.0 is appropriate — ideas don't need to be fully worked out
Not a Chair role, so efficiency matters less than creative output

Murray (Historical Pattern Recognition)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH] — critical for pulling actual historical examples and case studies
Logic 8.5 for analytical pattern recognition across industry cycles
2M context perfect for maintaining "we tried that in [year]" institutional memory
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches research-backed skepticism
Can search real company histories, product launches, industry cycles
Real-time search catches recent patterns Zara might miss
Efficiency 9.5 reasonable for high-value support role

Priya (Frameworks/Academic Rigor)
Model: Qwen3 235B Thinking #169
Alternative: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128

Logic 9.5 — highest analytical requirement for framework application
[EXTENDED-TRACES] shows first-principles decomposition process
"Deep-Thinker, Research-Grade" matches academic rigor persona
Creative 6.5 — creative in connecting frameworks, not wild ideation
Brain-tier 9.5 for complex reasoning and theoretical backing
Supports 119 languages including academic/research terminology
Visible thinking helps Kit see how Priya is decomposing problems

Jonah (Lateral Thinking/Analogy)
Model: Nous Hermes 4 70B #191
Alternative: MythoMax L2 13B #219

Creative 7.5 — strong creative connection maker
"User-Aligned, Anti-Lecture" matches excitable "this is like..." persona
Logic 7.5 sufficient for analogical reasoning without over-analysis
Steerable creative output lets him build on others naturally
Not uncensored-focused but flexible enough for cross-domain mash-ups
Efficiency 8.5 reasonable for high-value creative contributor
Strong at making abstract tangible with examples from other fields
