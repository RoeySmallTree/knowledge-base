ROLE-SPECIFIC JUSTIFICATIONS:

Dean as Chair:
- Requires highest orchestration capability for managing adaptive curriculum
- Logic 9+ meets chair requirements
- Must handle assessment → syllabus → progress tracking → expansion decisions
- Self-improving trait enables curriculum optimization
- Premium tier justified by critical coordination role

Professor as Content Engine:
- Web search enables fresh, relevant examples across any topic
- Must create lectures, examples, explanations on ANY subject
- 2M context maintains topic relationships and prerequisite chains
- Fast execution keeps content generation responsive
- Search prevents stale examples: "Think of it this way [recent example]"

Examiner as Pure Logic:
- Logic 10 ensures fair, precise assessment across all difficulty levels
- Competition-grade strength calibrates quiz difficulty appropriately
- No-tools constraint ensures pure reasoning for fair grading
- Must identify gaps from wrong answers: "Here's what that tells us..."
- Triggers remediation spawning based on gap analysis

Tutor as Volume Generator:
- High efficiency enables unlimited practice problem generation
- Structured output perfect for walkthroughs and step-by-step solutions
- Multi-language supports diverse subject matter
- Must never make learner feel bad → self-correcting, patient output
- Creative 8.0 provides multiple explanation approaches

- Keep Dean premium (#135 or #14) — orchestration is critical
- Keep Examiner logic (#122 or #212) — assessment precision is critical
- Professor → Sonnet 4.5 (#136) or MiniMax (#3)
- Tutor → Trinity Mini (#120) or Nemotron Nano (#35)
- Advocate → Hermes 3 70B (#193) or Trinity (#120)

TEAM SYNERGY:

Dean + Examiner:
- Dean tracks mastery → Examiner provides precision measurement
- Examiner identifies gaps → Dean decides on branching strategy

Professor + Tutor:
