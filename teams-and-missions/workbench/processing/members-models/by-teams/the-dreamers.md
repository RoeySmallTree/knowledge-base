Detailed Reasoning
Spark (Direction/Chair)
Model: Claude Sonnet 4.5 #136
Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Long-Horizon trait perfect for managing complex multi-stage expansion-to-implementation pipeline
Structured-Thinking matches facilitation and convergence responsibilities
30hr endurance allows managing full project lifecycle from dream to plan
Logic 8.5 handles process orchestration and synthesis
Creative 8.5 enables generating exploration directions
128K context tracks entire project evolution across all expansion phases
Production-Grade reliability for critical chair role
Can balance creative exploration and practical convergence

Nova (Expansion/Ideation)
Model: Euryale 70B v2.3 #213
Alternative: Hermes 4 70B #191

[SPATIAL-AWARE, CHARACTER-CONSISTENT] — perfect for infinite creative expansion
Creative 9.0 maximizes divergent thinking and unexpected connections
"Immersive, World-Builder" matches "expand infinitely" and "yes, and..." persona
131K context maintains all expansion threads and connections
Non-restrictive content allows wild, unconventional ideation without guardrails
Logic 6.0 appropriately lower — creativity > logic for this role
"Cannot stop expanding ideas" perfectly matches Euryale's generative nature

Form (Design/Synthesis)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Trinity Mini #120

Efficiency 9.5 for high-volume role that creates tangible expressions
"Precise, Self-Correcting" matches "synthesizes without constraining"
Native structured output ideal for creating coherent forms from chaos
Creative 8.0 enables creative synthesis while maintaining coherence
Logic 8.5 creates structure without over-constraining
Browser control could generate visual mockups or design references
#1 open-source efficiency makes this sustainable for design iteration

Ground (Budget/Planning)
Model: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35
Alternative: Phi 4 #212

Efficiency 10 — perfect for practical execution role
Logic 9.0 handles precise calculations for budgets and timelines
"Precise, Stepwise, Fast-Twitch" matches methodical planning persona
3.2B active params = cost-effective for analytical rather than creative work
Hybrid architecture handles complex constraint reasoning and resource optimization
Can rebuild entire plans when constraints change (not just patch)
Competition-math capability (via Phi 4 alternative) if calculations get complex

Scout (Research/Feasibility)
Model: Grok 4.1 Fast #138
Alternative: DeepResearch 30B #188

[WEB-SEARCH + X-SEARCH] — essential for researching precedents and regulations
2M context tracks all research findings, precedents, and regulatory details
Logic 8.5 for careful feasibility analysis
"Tool-Seeker, Analyst" matches research-driven persona
Can find regulatory paths, assess permit timelines, and verify feasibility
Real-time search catches current regulations and recent precedents
Fast-Twitch enables rapid research cycles during planning

Terra (Assumptions/Watchdog)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: QwQ-32B #181

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for assumption identification and dependency mapping
Logic 9.0 tracks assumptions rigorously and maps cascade effects
Chain-of-thought visibility shows exactly what assumptions are being tracked
"Deep-Thinker, Self-Correcting" matches "loves ideas but trusts nothing"
Open reasoning enables team to see dependency analysis
Memory 9.0 requirement met through visible reasoning chains
Can trigger reconstruction by identifying which assumptions broke
Quality control role ensures graceful adaptation when constraints change


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (1): Spark
├── High (4):     Nova, Form, Ground, Terra
└── Medium (1):   Scout

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [WEB-SEARCH]        Scout    — Precedent research, regulations
├── [SPATIAL-AWARE]     Nova     — World-building, infinite expansion
├── [CHARACTER-CONSIST] Nova     — Maintains creative voice across sessions
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Terra    — Assumption hunting, dependency tracking
├── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Form     — Creating coherent designs from chaos
└── [LONG-HORIZON]      Spark    — Managing full dream-to-plan pipeline

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium orchestration: Spark (#136)
├── Creative specialist:   Nova (#213)
├── Cost-optimized:        Form (#3), Ground (#35), Scout (#138)
└── Quality watchdog:      Terra (#128)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), Sao10K (1), MiniMax (1), NVIDIA (1), xAI (1), DeepSeek (1)

ROLE BALANCE:
├── Creative roles:   Spark, Nova, Form (3)
├── Analytical roles: Ground, Scout, Terra (3)
├── Research roles:   Scout (1 with web access)
└── Quality control:  Terra (1)

WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:
├── Spark → Nova:   Direction setting → Infinite expansion
├── Nova → Form:    Expansion → Synthesis into coherent form
├── Form → Ground:  Design → Practical implementation planning
├── Ground ↔ Scout: Planning ↔ Constraint research
├── Terra → All:    Assumption challenges → Reconstruction triggers
└── Convergence:    Spark synthesizes all inputs into deliverable blueprint

CONSTRAINT HANDLING:
Terra tracks assumptions across all phases, enabling graceful reconstruction rather than patching when constraints change (e.g., "half the budget" triggers full plan rebuild, not corner-cutting)
