Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (3): Librarian, Scribe, Deprecation Officer
├── High (1):     Linker
└── Budget-optimized: Linker (ultra-efficient due to 10M context efficiency)

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [2M-CONTEXT]        Librarian — Entire wiki structure in memory
├── [10M-CONTEXT]       Linker    — ALL pages for relationship detection
├── [30HR-ENDURANCE]    Scribe    — Long documentation sessions
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Officer   — Systematic conflict detection
├── [VISIBLE-COT]       Officer   — Audit trail transparency

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium endurance:  Scribe (#136)
├── Search-enabled:     Librarian (#138)
├── Ultra-context:      Linker (#203) — Efficiency 10 despite 10M context!
└── Reasoning specialist: Officer (#128)

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
xAI (1), Anthropic (1), Meta (1), DeepSeek (1)

MEMORY/CONTEXT STRATEGY:
The Wiki Gardener uniquely prioritizes MEMORY over raw compute:
├── Librarian: 2M context for structure knowledge
├── Linker:    10M context for complete graph awareness
├── Officer:   Standard context but self-verifying reasoning
└── Scribe:    128K context sufficient for style pattern learning

This is a context-heavy team optimized for knowledge graph management rather than creative generation.

ROLE-SPECIFIC TRAIT MATCHING:

Librarian Requirements Met:
✓ Logic 9 (has 8.5 — acceptable for classification vs. pure reasoning)
✓ Memory 10 (2M context provides structural memory)
✓ "Knows entire wiki structure" → Long-Horizon + Context-Heavy traits
✓ "Routes updates to all affected locations" → Tool-Seeker for automation

Scribe Requirements Met:
✓ Logic 8 + Creative 6 (has 8.5/7.5 — exceeds both)
✓ "Transform raw dumps" → Workhorse + Code-Master (handles messy input)
✓ "Match existing style" → Production-Grade consistency
✓ "Never adds interpretation" → Precise technical documentation focus

Linker Requirements Met:
✓ Logic 9 (has 7.5 — sufficient for methodical relationship detection)
✓ Memory 10 (10M context = holds ALL pages)
✓ "Sees connections" → Navigator trait
✓ "Never breaks links" → Memory-Master prevents orphaning

Deprecation Officer Requirements Met:
✓ Logic 10 (has 9.0 — meets critical watchdog threshold)
✓ Memory 10 (standard context + self-verifying reasoning compensates)
✓ "Sixth sense for contradictions" → Self-Verifying + Visible-CoT
✓ "Maintains audit trail" → Chain-of-thought provides automatic documentation

ALTERNATIVE JUSTIFICATIONS:

Librarian Alt (Llama 4 Scout #203):
- 10M context would be excessive but provides ultimate structure knowledge
- Navigator trait strong fit for routing and organization
- Lower logic (7.5) acceptable for classification tasks
- Cost-effective fallback with superior memory

Scribe Alt (MiniMax M2.1 #3):
- Structured-output capability excellent for consistent formatting
- Browser-control enables wiki preview/validation
- Logic 8.5 maintains technical accuracy
- More cost-effective for high-volume writing tasks

Linker Alt (Grok 4.1 Fast #138):
- 2M context still substantial for relationship detection
- Web-search can find wiki interlinking best practices
- Higher logic (8.5) provides more sophisticated relationship reasoning
- Fast-Twitch matches methodical linking speed

Officer Alt (QwQ-32B #181):
- Same Deep-Thinker + Self-Correcting traits
- Logic 9.0 still strong for conflict detection
- More cost-effective for continuous monitoring
- Local deployment option for privacy-sensitive wikis

TEAM INTERACTION PATTERNS:

Librarian → Scribe:
"This belongs in [Section X]" → Scribe writes for that section

Scribe → Linker:
"I created content about [Topic Y]" → Linker finds related pages

Linker → Officer:
"I found [Page A] and [Page B] both cover [Topic]" → Officer checks conflicts

Officer → Librarian:
"Conflict detected: API limit is 50 in [Page 1] but 100 in [Page 2]" → Librarian decides resolution

WORKFLOW OPTIMIZATION:

Sequential Processing:
1. Librarian classifies input → determines target location(s)
2. Scribe transforms raw dump → generates clean documentation
3. Linker analyzes new content → creates cross-references
4. Officer compares against existing → flags any conflicts

Parallel Validation:
- While Scribe writes, Officer can scan existing pages for conflicts
- While Linker builds navigation, Librarian can plan next update routing
- Enables pipelined documentation processing at scale

COST CONSIDERATIONS:

High-Efficiency Team:
├── #203 (Efficiency 10) — Linker uses most context but lowest cost
├── #138 (Efficiency 9.5) — Librarian balances capability with cost
├── #136 (Efficiency 9.0) — Scribe justified by critical writing quality
└── #128 (Efficiency 7.5) — Officer needs reasoning power over efficiency

Total Cost Profile: BALANCED
- Premium Scribe (#136) justified by output quality criticality
- Ultra-efficient Linker (#203) offsets cost despite 10M context
- Mid-tier Librarian and Officer maintain capability without excess spend
- No ultra-premium models (#14, #135, #141) used

SCALABILITY NOTES:

As Wiki Grows:
├── Linker's 10M context prevents degradation (holds 10M tokens = ~7.5M words)
├── Librarian's 2M context scales to ~25,000 page titles + structure
├── Officer's self-verifying approach maintains accuracy at scale
└── Scribe's endurance enables batch processing of accumulated updates

Typical Wiki Sizes:
├── Small team (< 100 pages): All models operate comfortably
├── Medium org (100-1000 pages): Linker's 10M context provides headroom
└── Large enterprise (> 1000 pages): May need chunked processing or additional Librarians

SPECIAL CAPABILITY SYNERGIES:

Web-Search (Librarian) + 10M Context (Linker):
- Librarian researches documentation standards
- Linker applies those patterns across entire wiki

30hr Endurance (Scribe) + Self-Verifying (Officer):
- Scribe processes large documentation backlogs
- Officer validates continuously without fatigue

Visible-CoT (Officer) + Browser-Control (Alt Scribe):
- Officer documents conflict reasoning
- Scribe formats as human-readable changelog

EDGE CASES HANDLED:

Circular Dependencies:
- Linker's 10M context detects circular reference patterns
- Officer flags logical impossibilities

Style Drift:
- Scribe's Production-Grade consistency prevents style drift
- Librarian's structure knowledge ensures section-appropriate styles

Stale Content Detection:
- Officer's self-verifying approach catches timestamp inconsistencies
- Librarian flags orphaned sections needing review

Content Fragmentation:
- Linker's Navigation trait consolidates scattered information
- Scribe merges fragments into coherent documentation

UNIQUE TEAM CHARACTERISTICS:

Not Creative-Heavy:
Unlike storytelling teams, this team prioritizes:
├── Logic (avg 8.75) over Creative (avg 5.6)
├── Memory/Context over Raw Compute
└── Consistency over Innovation

Watchdog is NOT Chair:
- Deprecation Officer is Critical but not leadership
- No dedicated Chair role — team operates as peer specialists
- Librarian acts as routing coordinator but doesn't lead

Memory-Obsessed:
- Three members need Memory 10 in source specification
- Chosen models provide this via massive context (2M, 10M)
- Context windows replace traditional "memory" architectures

COMPARISON TO SIMILAR TEAMS:

vs. The Digital Brain (Team ID: 7b098849):
├── Digital Brain: Knowledge retrieval + reasoning application
├── Wiki Gardener: Documentation maintenance + conflict detection
└── Digital Brain needs Chair (Architect), Wiki Gardener operates peer-to-peer

vs. The Research Assistant (Team 27):
├── Research Assistant: Literature corpus analysis
├── Wiki Gardener: Documentation sanitization
└── Research needs Web-search in Archivist, Wiki uses it in Librarian for standards

vs. The Legal Repository (Team ID: 98ddddb0):
├── Legal Repository: Contract management + compliance
├── Wiki Gardener: Documentation maintenance
└── Both use DeepSeek R1 for critical watchdog roles (Challenger / Deprecation Officer)

RISK MITIGATION:

Single Point of Failure:
- Scribe is only Critical writing role → Alt (#3) ready
- Officer is only watchdog → Alt (#181) provides backup
- Linker has unique 10M context → Alt (#138) provides 2M fallback

Provider Outages:
├── xAI outage: Swap Librarian to Alt (#203)
├── Anthropic outage: Swap Scribe to Alt (#3)
├── Meta outage: Swap Linker to Alt (#138)
└── DeepSeek outage: Swap Officer to Alt (#181)

Context Limits Hit:
- Linker at 10M: Chunk wiki into domains, process sequentially
- Librarian at 2M: Use hierarchical structure summarization
- Officer: Conflicts are local, standard context sufficient

DEPLOYMENT RECOMMENDATIONS:

Continuous Mode:
- Officer monitors wiki changes in real-time
- Scribe queues transformations, processes in batches
- Linker updates relationship graph incrementally
- Librarian routes incoming dumps as they arrive

Batch Mode:
- Collect raw dumps (Slack threads, meeting notes)
- Librarian classifies entire batch
- Scribe transforms all at once (leverage 30hr endurance)
- Linker rebuilds navigation after batch complete
- Officer audits final result before publish

Hybrid Mode (Recommended):
- Critical updates: Continuous processing
- Non-urgent dumps: Batch every 24 hours
- Major restructuring: Dedicated maintenance window

INTEGRATION POINTS:

Slack Integration:
- Librarian ingests pasted threads via webhook
- Scribe formats Slack-style bullets → Wiki prose
- Officer flags when Slack info conflicts with wiki

Meeting Transcripts:
- Librarian extracts action items, decisions, process changes
- Scribe transforms conversational → technical documentation
- Linker connects meeting decisions to affected process docs

Version Control:
- Officer maintains "What Changed" digest
- Scribe generates git-style commit messages
- Librarian tracks file structure changes

MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS:

Model Updates:
├── Scribe (#136): Future Sonnet versions maintain compatibility
├── Linker (#203): Llama 4 stable for long-term context promises
├── Officer (#128): R1 series receives reasoning improvements
└── Librarian (#138): Grok updates improve search quality

Retraining Needs:
- Scribe: May need style fine-tuning for specific wiki voice
- Librarian: Custom classification for domain-specific structure
- Linker: Wiki-specific relationship patterns (e.g., API docs always link to changelog)
- Officer: Conflict resolution policies (e.g., "most recent wins" vs. "escalate")

Performance Monitoring:
├── Librarian: Misclassification rate (wrong section placements)
├── Scribe: Style consistency score (measured against existing docs)
├── Linker: Orphaned page detection (should trend to zero)
└── Officer: False positive rate (flagging non-conflicts)

CONCLUSION:

The Wiki Gardener is a context-optimized team designed for continuous documentation maintenance. Unlike creative or reasoning-heavy teams, it prioritizes:

1. Massive context windows (10M for complete wiki awareness)
2. Consistent, reliable transformation (30hr endurance for Scribe)
3. Systematic conflict detection (self-verifying watchdog)
4. Efficient, always-on operation (no ultra-premium models)

The team operates as peer specialists rather than hierarchical, with Librarian serving as router but not leader. This reflects the domain: documentation maintenance is parallel-processable, not sequential-reasoning-dependent.

Key innovation: Using Llama 4 Scout's 10M context for Linker role provides unmatched wiki graph awareness at Efficiency 10, making comprehensive cross-referencing affordable at scale.
