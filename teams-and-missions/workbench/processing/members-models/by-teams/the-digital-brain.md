Alternative: Gemini 3 Pro Preview #14

Logic 8.5 handles complex structural reasoning and classification decisions
30-hour endurance perfect for maintaining mental model of entire knowledge base
"Production coding" experience translates to production-grade structuring
Memory 10 requirement met through extended context handling
Coherence focus ensures schema doesn't break as repository scales
Not chair-tier pricing, but quality needed for critical coordination role
Coordinates team workflow — needs reliability and consistency

Librarian (Memory/Retrieval/Indexing)
Model: Llama 4 Scout #203
Alternative: Grok 4.1 Fast #138

[LONG-CONTEXT] — 10M token context is perfect for "knows where everything is"
Efficiency 10.0 for high-volume retrieval operations
Can hold massive indexes and cross-reference maps in working memory
"Scout" designation suggests exploration and navigation capabilities
Logic 7.5 sufficient for relevance matching and classification
Budget-friendly for supporting role despite being memory-critical
Long context enables finding connections across entire repository
Perfect for "unexpected but relevant knowledge" retrieval

Analyst (Logic/Reasoning)
Model: DeepSeek V3.2-Speciale #122
Alternative: Qwen3 235B Thinking #169

Logic 10.0 — "must reason flawlessly" requirement
[COMPETITION-MATH] — IMO/IOI gold medal capability for rule application
"Show your work" persona matches visible reasoning chains
Efficiency 5.0 acceptable for critical reasoning role
Handles complex rule application and derivation chains
Perfect for "never guess" requirement — rigorous logical foundation
Note: NO tools needed for pure reasoning tasks
Can execute calculations and procedures with mathematical precision

Opposition (Challenge/Devil's Advocate)
Model: DeepSeek R1 0528 #128
Alternative: INTELLECT-3 #134

[SELF-VERIFYING, VISIBLE-COT] — perfect for finding unstated assumptions
Logic 9.0 for reasoning about contradictions and gaps
"Self-Correcting" trait matches stress-testing persona
Chain-of-thought visibility shows exactly what's being challenged
Open reasoning lets team see Opposition's analysis process
Efficiency 7.5 reasonable for high-importance role
Creative 7.0 sufficient for imagining alternative interpretations
Purpose-built for adversarial reasoning and assumption hunting

Sentinel (Quality/Currency/Verification)
Model: MiniMax M2.1 #3
Alternative: Nemotron 3 Nano 30B #35

Efficiency 9.5 for supporting verification role
"Precise, Self-Correcting" matches quality vigilance persona
Logic 8.5 handles currency reasoning and conflict detection
Native structured output for staleness dashboards and reports
Multi-source synthesis ability for tracking freshness across repository
Browser control could enable automated freshness checking
Efficiency tier appropriate for systematic verification tasks
Proven in production environments for reliability


Cost & Trait Analysis
CRITICALITY DISTRIBUTION:
├── Critical (4): Architect, Librarian, Analyst, Sentinel
├── High (1):     Opposition
└── Budget-optimized: Librarian, Sentinel

SPECIAL TRAITS UTILIZED:
├── [LONG-CONTEXT]      Librarian  — 10M tokens for full repository indexing
├── [COMPETITION-MATH]  Analyst    — Flawless rule application and calculations
├── [SELF-VERIFYING]    Opposition — Assumption hunting, gap detection
├── [VISIBLE-COT]       Opposition — Transparent challenge process
└── [STRUCTURED-OUTPUT] Sentinel   — Staleness dashboards and reports

EFFICIENCY TIERS:
├── Premium reasoning:   Analyst (#122)
├── Production quality:  Architect (#136)
├── Memory specialist:   Librarian (#203)
├── Verification focus:  Opposition (#128)
└── Cost-optimized:     Sentinel (#3)

LOGIC DISTRIBUTION:
├── 10.0: Analyst     — Flawless reasoning requirement
├── 9.0:  Architect   — Complex structural decisions
├── 9.0:  Opposition  — Adversarial reasoning
├── 9.0:  Sentinel    — Currency and conflict detection
└── 8.0:  Librarian   — Relevance matching

PROVIDER DIVERSITY: ✓
Anthropic (1), Meta (1), DeepSeek (2), MiniMax (1)

COST PROFILE:
├── Knowledge work demands precision over speed
├── Four critical roles justify quality investment
├── Librarian uses efficiency champion despite criticality (context > compute)
├── Sentinel optimized for high-volume verification
└── Overall: Balanced — premium reasoning where needed, efficient retrieval/verification

FALLBACK STRATEGY:
├── Architect: #136 → #14 → #141 → #63
├── Librarian: #203 → #138 → #65 → #213
├── Analyst: #122 → #169 → #60 → #63
├── Opposition: #128 → #134 → #169 → #132
└── Sentinel: #3 → #35 → #120 → #188

REASONING NOTES:
1. **Memory Requirements**: Librarian gets 10M context for repository-wide indexing
2. **Logic Requirements**: Analyst needs absolute precision — competition-math grade
3. **Coordination**: Architect handles structure + team coordination, needs reliability
4. **Transparency**: Opposition's visible CoT enables team to see challenge process
5. **Verification**: Sentinel's structured output crucial for dashboards and reports
6. **No Search Needed**: Pure knowledge management, no external data required
7. **Self-Contained**: All models work with internally stored knowledge only
8. **Quality Over Speed**: Knowledge base correctness more important than response time

TEAM SYNERGY:
- Architect structures → Librarian indexes → Analyst reasons → Opposition challenges → Sentinel verifies
- Clear handoff points between roles minimize confusion
- No model used twice (good diversity)
- Logic scores progress: 8.5 → 7.5 → 10 → 9 → 8.5
- Memory scores appropriately distributed: 10, 10, 9, 8, 9
- Creative scores low across board (4-7) — correct for systematic knowledge work
