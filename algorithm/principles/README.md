# Principles - Context Guide

## Purpose
Restructures the Unified Team Orchestration operating specification into governance, roles, artifacts, process, and quality files while preserving original numbering (e.g., 1.1-1.6) and examples for cross-reference.

## Quick Navigation
- **Start here:** governance.md - Scope/invariants and core principles, including decision governance
- **Roles:** roles.md - Governance roles, persistent personas, team-role field, collab tone
- **Artifacts:** artifacts.md - Product model, structural operations, cross-domain examples
- **Process:** process.md - Operating cycle, collaboration, reflection, envoy guidance, context capture, optional mitigation
- **Quality:** quality.md - Success metrics, improvement pressure, quality controls, compliance checklists, glossary
- **Prompting:** prompting.md - Prompt ethos, context discipline, reflection script, directive and mission brief patterns

## Sub-areas
- No deeper sub-areas; this folder is the entry point for principles.

## Related Context
- [../README.md](../README.md) - Algorithm navigation
- [../approach.md](../approach.md) - High-level orchestration approach
- [../core-concepts.md](../core-concepts.md) - Core data and collaboration concepts

## When to Explore This
- Defining or auditing orchestration governance
- Assigning roles/personas and collaboration tone
- Designing or adjusting Product Tree structures
- Planning round flows, collab patterns, or envoy presentations
- Setting success metrics, DoD, and quality controls
- Crafting high-intensity prompts, reflections, and mission briefs

## Notes
- Numbering from the source specification remains stable across files.
- All original logic and examples are preserved; use the file indicated by the quick navigation to find the relevant section.
