# Quality, Metrics, and Acceptance

## Purpose
Collects success metrics, improvement pressure, quality controls, compliance checklists, and glossary terms that govern acceptance.

## 1.4 Success Metrics (numeric, concrete)
Each product should define numeric success metrics and Definition of Done (DoD) criteria. Review and acceptance occur through this lens (not exclusively, but explicitly).

**Examples**
- Marketing plan -> estimated conversion >= 12%, email open rate >= 1%
- Efficiency improvement -> runtime complexity -30%
- Business objectives -> ARR >= $250K
- Milestones -> 200 customers in month 2; 3,000 by month 6
- Research -> find 3 psychological triggers, etc.

## 1.5 Improvement Aspirations (version pressure)
- Results must continuously improve, and receive explicit challenge from operatives, chair, and author.
- Versions are rated on clarity, actionability, quality, DoD fit, contribution to project DoD, and coherence with sibling products.
- Below a set grade -> flagged in collab / not accepted by the chair.

## 10) Metrics, Quality & Improvement (supporting Sections 1.4-1.5)
- Each product tracks numeric success metrics and DoD; acceptance and critique must explicitly reference them.
- Maintain version pressure: rate versions for clarity, actionability, quality, DoD fit, contribution to project DoD, and coherence; low-grade versions are flagged/not accepted.

## Quick Compliance Checklists (restating existing logic)

### Before building (Chair):
- [ ] Underlying objectives stated (Section 1.1)
- [ ] Context complete and saved (Section 1.3)
- [ ] Decision Products drafted where needed (Section 4.1)
- [ ] Metrics and DoD defined (Section 1.4)
- [ ] Structure matches node rules (Section 3.x)

### During each round:
- [ ] Operatives reflected and requested structural changes (Sections 5.1, 7)
- [ ] Chair assigned/approved with clear directives (Section 5.2)
- [ ] New versions produced (Section 5.3)
- [ ] Peer reviews posted (Section 5.4)
- [ ] Watchdog QA done (Section 5.5)
- [ ] Envoy presented naturally, concisely, with references (Sections 5.6, 8)

### Collab and tone:
- [ ] Collabs are contextual, role-faithful, advancement-oriented (Section 6.1)
- [ ] "HOW: .." robotic style avoided (Section 6.2)

### Ownership and roles:
- [ ] `team-role` set and acknowledged (Section 2.3)
- [ ] Persistent personas maintained (Section 2.2)
- [ ] Derived tasks stay with original owner (Section 1.6)

### Structure ops:
- [ ] Nested creation used where helpful (Section 11.1)
- [ ] Chair adjusts structure freely (Section 11.2)

## Glossary (clarifying terms, no new logic)
- DoD (Definition of Done): Explicit acceptance criteria, often numeric (Section 1.4), for a node/version.
- Delta (Round Delta): The set of changes, approvals, rejections, new directives, and structural adjustments across a round (Section 5.2).
- Mitigation (optional): Auxiliary LLM step to brief roles (Section 13.A).

This restructured specification keeps all original logic, examples, and constraints intact while making governance, roles, artifacts, process, and quality controls explicit and easy to navigate.
