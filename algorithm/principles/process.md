# Process

## Purpose
Outlines the operating cycle, collaboration patterns, reflections, envoy guidance, and context capture expectations that govern each round.

## 5) Operating Cycle (Round Flow)

### 5.1 Reflection (7.1)
Operatives review latest products considering peer-review collabs and context; they state changes for next version and requested structural changes.

### 5.2 Plan & Assign (7.2)
Chair synthesizes round deltas (user/peer collabs, latest versions, structural requests) and assesses:
- Progress vs. objectives
- Validity/quality of content
- Required executive decisions

**Outputs:** approvals/rejections and assignments to products; structural changes; operative assignments with clear round directives; new directives/products/decisions; concluding decisions.

### 5.3 Write (7.3)
Operatives create new improved versions with the fresh directive and reflective insights.

### 5.4 Peer Review (7.4)
Operatives critique/encourage via collabs on new versions. For Decision nodes, collabs help resolve the decision.

### 5.5 Inspection (7.5)
Watchdog QA flags: security risks, data misuse, coherency/order issues, completeness gaps (e.g., marked "done" but not meeting DoD), style mismatches, etc., via collabs.

### 5.6 Presentation (7.6)
Envoy compiles round events into user-facing chat messages (see Section 8).

## 6) Collaboration (Collabs)

### 6.1 Collabs on Content
- Collabs must be genuine inputs from the collab-maker's role perspective, using full project context.
- They must advance the project, bridge gaps across components, and challenge the author's conception where needed.

### 6.2 Tone Rule (again)
- Avoid dystopian, robotic "HOW: .." style; it signals poor prompt structure and yields low-value comments.

## 7) Reflection Notes (what they must contain)
Include:
- Planned improvements/additions for V(x+1)
- How new collabs/chair directives/other recent content changed the DoD perception and exposed gaps
- Pending decisions, instincts, and confidence levels
- Explicit structural requests (add/delete products, alter structure/DoD). Chair applies changes accordingly.

Base reflections on:
- Received collab comments (absorb criticism/suggestions)
- Recently seen peer content (peer-review phase)
- Latest chair directives
- Watchdog collabs
- User collabs
- Fresh look at the content and new improvement ideas

## 8) Envoy Presentation (user-facing chat)
- The current envoy output must not be generic bullshit like "Hey guys let's keep it going" or "Friendly reminder...".
- Simulate natural conversation (e.g., WhatsApp-style), not corporate emails. No forced "Hey guys" openers.

**Key considerations:**
- Roles & characteristics. Reflect personas (writing style, interests, gender, etc.).
- Round deltas. Include meaningful changes: added/altered/approved/rejected/directed items.
- Conciseness. Prefer few-word messages, many short lines if needed (like quick comments while working).
- Referencing. Attach referenced products; @-mention recipients (e.g., `@operative3`). Messages originating from a collab are sent by the collab's creator to the product owner.

## 9) Context & Information Management (supporting Section 1.3)
- Proactively collect, research, and store all necessary inputs as Content Products or in collabs/DoDs.
- Do not advance workstreams without complete, saved context.

## 13) Thoughts (as options, unchanged)

### A. Mitigation sub-step.
Optionally use an extra LLM to "mitigate" the task to members with tailored prompt tempering (reminding each specialist of their role, mission importance, underlying objectives). Incorporate if a static approach is insufficient.

### B. Structural rules to cherish.
The structural instructions--how response objects look and what's allowed--are paramount. They enable LLMs to interact with the collaboration structures reliably; this is the cornerstone of improved collaboration.
