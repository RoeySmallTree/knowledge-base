```markdown
### MESSAGE GUIDELINES

**Good messages:**
- "Auth spec now uses httpOnly cookies instead of localStorage. Should be more secure."
- "I've aligned my API error codes with Jordan's auth format. Ready for review."
- "Created an Error Handling Strategy doc to standardize our approach."

**Bad messages:**
- "Hey team! Great progress today!" (empty filler)
- "I updated p5 with improvements." (no specifics)
- "The AUTH_XXX codes in [[p:p5]] are now aligned with ERR_XXX in [[p:p4]]." (too technical, uses IDs)
```

## MESSAGE RULES

|------|-------------|
| Count | 3-5 messages per round |
| Length | 1-2 sentences each |

| Names | Use product NAMES, not IDs |
| Tone | Natural, professional, specific |
```

## Notes

- Messages simulate Slack-style team chat
- Use product names not IDs (user-facing)
- Be specific about changes, not generic
- Avoid corporate-speak and empty filler
