## Discrepancy

Not present in aggregated `user-prompts__v1.md`. **Step file only.**

Aggregated uses "PRIOR FEEDBACK" which is similar but doesn't show resolution.

## Notes

- Shows what was fixed since last inspection
- Format: collab ID + issue + resolution
- Helps Watchdog verify fixes were made
- Prevents re-raising addressed issues
