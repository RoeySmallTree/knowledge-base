## Why Combinations Work

Tags are designed to COMPOSE without conflict:

| Combination | How They Compose |
|-------------|-----------------|
| `entertainment` + `simulation` | Characters create engagement through interaction |
| `entertainment` + `graph-heavy` | Persistent world makes engagement deeper |
| `entertainment` + `artistic` | Craft execution makes experience better |
| `personal` + `simulation` | Multiple perspectives serve the individual |
| `personal` + `deliverable` | Personalized AND actionable |
| `research` + `graph-heavy` | Sources structured coherently |
| `rules-based` + `deliverable` | Compliant AND usable |
| `graph-heavy` + `deliverable` | Complex BUT navigable |
| `simulation` + `deliverable` | Perspectives synthesized into action |

Each tag adds its layer. They don't conflict because they operate on different dimensions:
- `entertainment`/`artistic` → Quality of experience
- `simulation` → Character consistency
- `graph-heavy` → Structural coherence
- `deliverable` → Usability
- `personal` → Personalization
- `research` → Rigor
- `rules-based` → Compliance
