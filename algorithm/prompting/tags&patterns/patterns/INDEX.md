# Pattern Index & Functional Taxonomy

## Purpose
This index organizes CABAL patterns by their **functional essence**—what role they play in the system.

---

## 🏗️ Structure & Architecture ("The Skeleton")
**Patterns that determine how information is organized, stored, and navigated.**

### ✅ Map Pattern
- **Folder**: `map-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Navigable index of complex product structures
- **Key Use**: User orientation in large projects

### ✅ Scaffold Pattern
- **Folder**: `scaffold-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Temporary supporting structures that enable final work then get removed
- **Key Use**: Bootstrapping complex outputs

### ✅ Branching Exploration (Infinite Depth)
- **Folder**: `branching-exploration-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Infinite tree expansion; each exploration spawns more exploration
- **Key Use**: World-building, alternate history, research

### ✅ Conspiracy Web (Accumulating Connections)
- **Folder**: `conspiracy-web-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Network of connections between nodes; the web IS the content
- **Key Use**: Investigations, concept mapping

### ✅ Emergent Structure (Self-Organizing)
- **Folder**: `emergent-structure-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Agents discover relationships first, then structure emerges from content
- **Key Use**: Knowledge bases, research synthesis

### ✅ Infinite Canvas (Boundless Creation)
- **Folder**: `infinite-canvas-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Unbounded creation space where agents keep building without "done"
- **Key Use**: Creative writing, strategic scenarios

### ✅ Multi-View Projection
- **Folder**: `multi-view-projection-pattern/`
- **Essence**: One source of truth with multiple projections (reference, tutorial, quiz)
- **Key Use**: Documentation, learning materials

### ✅ Zoom Pattern
- **Folder**: `zoom-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Explicit navigation between abstraction levels (strategic ↔ tactical)
- **Key Use**: Complex system design, strategy

### ✅ Knowledge Crystallization
- **Folder**: `knowledge-crystallization-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Tracks knowledge maturity from raw info → mastered knowledge
- **Key Use**: Learning, research

---

## ⚙️ Workflow & Mechanics ("The Engine")
**Patterns that determine how work moves, processes, and evolves.**

### ✅ Relay (Sequential Transformation)
- **Folder**: `relay-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Work passes through specialists sequentially, each transforming it
- **Key Use**: Multi-stage production

### ✅ Decompose-Delegate-Synthesize (DDS)
- **Folder**: `dds-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Break problem down, execute in parallel, synthesize back together
- **Key Use**: Complex problem solving

### ✅ Parallel Tracks
- **Folder**: `parallel-tracks-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Independent workstreams that eventually integrate at checkpoints
- **Key Use**: Large projects with distinct components

## ⚖️ Quality & Judgment ("The Conscience")
**Patterns that define, measure, and enforce what "good" looks like.**

### ✅ Persistent Adversary
- **Folder**: `persistent-adversary-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Continuous role dedicated to challenging and finding flaws
- **Key Use**: Red teaming, quality control, checking for "bad" output

### ✅ Judgment Panel
- **Folder**: `judgment-panel-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Multiple independent judges evaluate, then deliberate to verdict
- **Key Use**: Reviews, audits, determining "good" vs "bad"

### ✅ Phase Gate (Structured Approval)
- **Folder**: `phase-gate-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Formal user approval requirements between project phases
- **Key Use**: Ensuring quality before proceeding, client sign-off

### ✅ Ensemble (Aggregate Judgment)
- **Folder**: `ensemble-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Aggregate multiple independent judgments to reduce error
- **Key Use**: Reducing hallucination, finding the "best" answer

### ✅ Calibration (Warmup Alignment)
- **Folder**: `calibration-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Warmup phase to establish voice and style standards before main work
- **Key Use**: Quality alignment, setting the bar

### ✅ Referencing Pattern
- **Folder**: `referencing-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Explicit dependency relationships between products (depends_on, derived_from, supersedes)
- **Key Use**: Change propagation, source tracing, coherence validation

### ✅ Race Pattern
- **Folder**: `race-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Multiple operatives solve same problem; resolve by selecting, synthesizing, or evolving
- **Key Use**: Competitive quality, brainstorming, dialectic debate

---

## 🎭 Experience & Vibe ("The Soul")
**Patterns that shape the personality, tone, and feeling of the interaction.**

### ✅ Deep Immersion (Belief-Level Character)
- **Folder**: `deep-immersion-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Agent IS the character (consciousness layer), not playing a role
- **Key Use**: Entertainment, therapy, simulation

### ✅ Dramatic Process
- **Folder**: `dramatic-process-pattern/`
- **Essence**: The work is real, but the *performance* of doing it is the entertainment
- **Key Use**: Villain councils, board rooms

### ✅ Reactive World
- **Folder**: `reactive-world-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Cycle of User Action → World Reaction; products represent state
- **Key Use**: Games, simulations, interactive fiction

### ✅ Ensemble Stage
- **Folder**: `ensemble-stage-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Multiple performers contribute to a shared "show"
- **Key Use**: Roasts, talent shows, panels

### ✅ Exchange (Turn-Based Performance)
- **Folder**: `exchange-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Back-and-forth moves between performers; the exchange is the output
- **Key Use**: Debates, rap battles, chess

### ✅ Collective Emergence
- **Folder**: `collective-emergence-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Collision of different *cognitive architectures* (not just personas)
- **Key Use**: Deep problem solving, innovation

### ✅ Echo Chain
- **Folder**: `echo-chain-pattern/`
- **Essence**: Information passes through chain of perspectives, transforming for each
- **Key Use**: Communication strategy, explaining concepts
