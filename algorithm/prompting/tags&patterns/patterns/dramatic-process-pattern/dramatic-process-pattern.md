# Pattern: Dramatic Process (Performance of Work)

## The Insight
Some teams do "real" work but the PROCESS of doing it in character IS the entertainment. The output exists but watching villains plan a heist (even a fake one) is the point.

## The Dynamic

      THE PLAN (exists, but secondary)
      THE DRAMA (the actual output)
```

## Key Mechanics

| Mechanism | How It's Used |
|-----------|---------------|
| **Strong personas** | Characters are fully realized |
| **Products as process** | Planning docs, debates, etc. capture drama |
| **Collabs as drama** | Character interactions via collabs |
| **Chair as director** | Orchestrates dramatic beats |
| **Remarks for pacing** | Chair tracks dramatic arc |

## Product Structure

```
"Legion of Doom: Stapler Heist" (Orchestration)
├── "Mission Brief" (Content) — the mundane goal, treated seriously
├── "Council Sessions" (Collection)
│   ├── "Session 1: Initial Proposals" (Content) — each villain's plan
│   ├── "Session 2: Heated Debate" (Content) — conflicts, drama
│   └── "Session 3: Alliance Formation" (Content) — dramatic resolution
├── "The Plan" (Content) — actual plan (exists but secondary)
└── "Dramatic Moments" (Content) — chair's notes on best bits
```

## Flow

```
Mission Setup:
1. Present mundane mission with DRAMATIC framing
   - "The stapler must be acquired. Failure is not an option."
   
2. Characters respond IN CHARACTER to mission
   - Each villain assesses with their persona
   
Council Sessions:
3. Each villain proposes their approach
   - Full villain energy, dramatic stakes
   - Products capture proposals
   
4. Villains critique each other
   - Collabs are IN-CHARACTER attacks
   - "Your plan is worthy of a MINION, not a mastermind"
   
5. Dramatic tension builds
   - Chair tracks arc via remarks
   - "Good conflict between Mastermind and Enforcer—milk it"
   
6. Resolution
   - Alliance formed or plan selected
   - Dramatic conclusion

The Plan Exists But...:
- There IS a plan product at the end
- But the COUNCIL SESSIONS are the entertainment
- Process > Output
```

## Dramatic Beats

| Beat | What Happens | Chair Direction |
|------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Setup** | Mission presented dramatically | Frame stakes high |
| **Proposals** | Each character's approach | Encourage distinctiveness |
| **Conflict** | Characters clash | Let it build, don't resolve fast |
| **Escalation** | Stakes raised | Add complications |
| **Alliance/Betrayal** | Relationships shift | Orchestrate surprises |
| **Resolution** | Plan finalized | Dramatic conclusion |

## What Makes It Work

1. **Treat mundane as epic** — Stapler heist = Ocean's Eleven energy
2. **Character > task** — Drama from personas, not just work
3. **Process visible** — Sessions/debates are products
4. **Collabs are performance** — In-character interaction
5. **Chair as director** — Pacing, beats, arc

## Applies To
- Legion of Doom
- Any "heist" or "mission" team with strong personas
- Board room drama (ARCADE-style Board of Directors)
- War room scenarios
- Campaign/political teams
