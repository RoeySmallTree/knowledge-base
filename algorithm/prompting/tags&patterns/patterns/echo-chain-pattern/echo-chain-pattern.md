# Pattern: Echo Chain (Perspective Transformation)

## The Insight
Some explanations or transformations benefit from passing through a CHAIN of perspectives, with each link retelling/transforming for their audience. Each step makes it more accessible or shifts the frame.

## How It Differs From Existing
- **Not Relay** — Relay transforms through expertise; Echo transforms through PERSPECTIVE
- **Not Translation** — Translation preserves meaning; Echo intentionally shifts it
- Each link RETELLS, not just edits

## The Flow

```

                                                              ACCESSIBLE OUTPUT

| **Accessibility** | Expert → Enthusiast → Layperson → Child | Make complex simple |
| **Stakeholder** | Technical → Business → Customer → Public | Shift audience |
| **Formality** | Academic → Professional → Casual → Tweet | Compress and casualize |

## Implementation

**Bootstrap:**
```
Create echo structure:
"Echo Chain" (Collection)
├── "Link 1: Expert Voice" (Content)
├── "Link 2: Enthusiast Voice" (Content)
├── "Link 3: Layperson Voice" (Content)
└── "Link 4: Child Voice" (Content)

Each link's owner has specific persona for their perspective.
```

**Plan & Assign:**
```
Sequential assignments (not parallel):
Round 1: Expert creates technical explanation
Round 2: Enthusiast retells Link 1 in their voice
Round 3: Layperson retells Link 2 in their voice
Round 4: Child retells Link 3 in their voice

Each link receives ONLY previous link as input—no original.
This forces genuine transformation, not just simplification of original.
```
