    - when confirming the marking irrelevant, this error appears:
        ExploreCard.tsx:77 Uncaught TypeError: onToggleExpand is not a function
  
    - apply the confirmation dialog of the marking irrelevant on delete model, archive model, and any other alert() instance (with the respective message) 

    - when the date filter buttons applied (2 days for example) they should indicate that they're selected (in addition to changing the date) 

    - the status in model explore expanded card is overflowing the pricing - fix the orientation
