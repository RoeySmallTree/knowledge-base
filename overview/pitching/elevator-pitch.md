# Elevator Pitch

**Status:** Codified — Aligned with main pitch

## 30-Second Version

CABAL is the operating system for AI collaboration—a protocol that commands multiple models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity) as a coordinated team. Each model takes a role and works in structured rounds—reflection, planning, writing, review—to build and verify outputs like a human task force, only faster. That means fewer errors, deeper insight, and results you can trust.

## Key Talking Points

When expanding beyond 30 seconds, emphasize:

1. **The Problem:** Isolated prompts give single answers; no cross-checking or iteration.  
2. **Our Solution:** Orchestrate multiple models into roles with structured rounds and product trees.  
3. **Unique Value:** Recursive collaboration that reviews its own work, pays per round, and produces trustworthy, structured deliverables.

## For Different Audiences

### For Technical Audience
Command a multi-model task force with explicit roles, reflection loops, and inspection phases; outputs stay organized in product trees for iterative builds.

### For Business Audience
Trusted outputs and speed: models review each other, catch mistakes, and deliver structured results; pay per round, not per chaotic prompt.

### For End Users
It feels like a team that already knows how to work together—assemble roles, run a round, get a vetted answer, and keep iterating.

## Opening Hooks

Conversation starters that lead into the pitch:

- "Command the AI collective. Not just one model."  
- "What happens when AIs review each other’s work?"  
- "Pay per round, not per prompt—because rigor needs structure."
