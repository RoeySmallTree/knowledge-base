Cabal
 Command the AI Collective
Cabal turns disconnected AI models—OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity—into a coordinated team.
Each takes on a role. Each plays a part. Together, they work in structured rounds to think, plan, write, and review—just like a human team. Only faster.
Why it matters
 Most AI tools today work in isolation: one prompt in, one answer out. Cabal makes them work together like a task force—reviewing each other’s work, catching mistakes, building structured outputs, and evolving projects across multiple iterations. That means fewer errors, deeper insights, and results you can actually trust.
How it works
Team Assembly: Mix-and-match models into specialized roles.
Structured Rounds: Reflection, planning, writing, review, inspection, presentation.
Product Trees: Organize outputs into living documents and collections.
Billing Simplicity: Pay per round, not per chaotic prompt.
Who it’s for
Startups & builders who need more than a chatbot.
Researchers & analysts who want cross-checked, long-form answers.
Agencies & teams who need structured deliverables fast.
The promise
 Cabal isn’t another AI app. It’s the operating system for AI collaboration—a way to command multiple intelligences as one, and to finally harness their combined power for serious work.
And one more thing…
Every breakthrough began the same way: by letting systems outpace us. Fire. Engines. Fission. Now—intelligence.
What happens when AIs don’t just answer questions, but build their own structures?
Cabal unlocks recursive collaboration—where AI teams can reflect, plan, and expand without limits. Instead of stopping at your prompt, they can take it further: proposing new directions, chaining research, and evolving knowledge structures far beyond what one human could anticipate.
This isn’t just productivity. It’s nuclear capability: the possibility of breakthroughs emerging from AI itself, amplified through limitless cycles of iteration. A collective intelligence that doesn’t just assist—but begins to outpace imagination.
With Cabal, you’re not just managing AI. You’re holding the controls to the next leap in the AI revolution.
