# Technical Specifications - Context Guide

## Purpose

This area contains detailed technical specifications for implementing CABAL's algorithms and systems. Use these when you need implementation-level detail beyond the high-level approach.

## Quick Navigation

[To be populated as technical specification documents are created]

- **[Spec 1]**: [spec-file.md] - [Brief description]
- **[Spec 2]**: [spec-file.md] - [Brief description]

## Structure

Technical specifications should be added here as needed, organized by:

- **Feature/Component**: One spec per major feature or component
- **Detail Level**: Implementation-ready specifications
- **Format**: Clear problem statement, solution design, data structures, algorithms, edge cases

## Template for New Specs

When creating a new technical specification, include:

1. **Overview**: What this spec covers
2. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
3. **Design**: Architecture and approach
4. **Data Structures**: Detailed structure definitions
5. **Algorithms**: Pseudocode or detailed descriptions
6. **API/Interfaces**: How components interact
7. **Edge Cases**: Special cases and error handling
8. **Testing Strategy**: How to validate implementation
9. **Performance**: Expected characteristics and optimization notes

## When to Create a Spec

Create a new technical specification when:

- Implementing a new major feature
- Algorithm is complex enough to need detailed documentation
- Multiple people will work on related code
- Design decisions need to be documented
- Implementation has non-obvious trade-offs

## Related Context

- **High-level approach:** See [../approach.md](../approach.md)
- **Core concepts:** See [../core-concepts.md](../core-concepts.md)
- **Code organization:** See [/CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md)

## When to Explore This

**Explore when:**
- Implementing complex features
- Need detailed algorithm specifications
- Writing tests for algorithmic components
- Optimizing performance
- Debugging algorithm-related issues

**Skip when:**
- High-level understanding is sufficient
- Working on non-algorithmic code
- Specs don't exist yet for your area
