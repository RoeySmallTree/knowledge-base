# Messaging Guidelines

**Status:** Codified — Brand codex locked

## Core Message

CABAL is not SaaS. It is an intelligence protocol — a silent collective that orchestrates on command and recruits those who suspect there is more.

## Tagline(s)

### Primary Tagline
**"Access CABAL. Identify. Then, take command."**

**When to use:** Hero sections, signup/auth flows, entry into gated experiences.  
**Why it works:** States the act (access), the requirement (identify), and the reward (command) without selling.

### Alternative Taglines
- **"Not just an AI tool. An intelligence protocol."**  
  **When to use:** Product overviews, ads, and site metadata where category clarity matters.
- **"A silent collective for those who take command."**  
  **When to use:** Community invites, private session prompts, feature teases.
- **"You are beyond intelligence. Welcome."**  
  **When to use:** High-tier (Govern) surfaces, upgrade moments, deep feature reveals.

## Key Messages

### Message 1: Protocol over product

**Core statement:**
CABAL is a protocol for orchestrating AI collectives, not a productivity app.

**Supporting points:**
- Operates like command software; assumes user capability.  
- Minimizes exposition; relies on signals, stages, and gates.  
- Native currency (`⟁`) and access rituals reinforce protocol over SaaS.

**Example usage:**
Use in homepage hero and product pages to reset expectations and differentiate from “AI wrappers.”

---

### Message 2: Controlled access, rising clearance

**Core statement:**
Entry is staged: Observe → Conspire → Govern. Each step is deeper clearance, not a price ladder.

**Supporting points:**
- Observe acknowledges curiosity.  
- Conspire empowers control; tools obey.  
- Govern confers authority; the system works for them.

**Example usage:**
Use in plan comparisons, gating states, and lifecycle messaging. Keep stage lines verbatim.

---

### Message 3: Selected, not sold

**Core statement:**
CABAL invites the user; it does not persuade. The brand’s confidence filters in the right people.

**Supporting points:**
- Language is clipped and unbothered.  
- Errors and permission gates reinforce mystique instead of apologizing.  
- Signals > explanations; intrigue is intentional.

**Example usage:**
Use in nurture flows, error states, and upgrade prompts to maintain the sense of being chosen.

## Value Propositions

### For Builders and 10x-ers (Conspire)

**Primary value:**
Direct control over an AI collective that executes with depth and speed.

**Key message:**
*"You are a 10x-er. Take control."*

**Proof points:**
- Command-led interface; tools obey, not suggest.  
- Native stages and gates keep focus and flow deliberate.

---

### For Strategic Leaders (Govern)

**Primary value:**
Authority over the system — clearance, private sessions, and orchestration without friction.

**Key message:**
*"You are beyond intelligence. Welcome."*

**Proof points:**
- Private sessions as a gated privilege.  
- Language mirrors high-clearance environments and reinforces control.

## Language Patterns

### Words We Use

**Preferred vocabulary:**
- **Access:** For entry points and authentication.  
- **Protocol:** For process, rules, and acceptance.  
- **Observe / Conspire / Govern:** For stages and pricing.  
- **Gate / Clearance / Denied:** For permissions and errors.  
- **Return to Safety:** For exits and recovery paths.  
- **⟁:** For native credits; only where balance is shown or granted.

**Why these words:** They signal controlled systems, reinforce the lore, and keep the voice clipped and elite-coded.

### Words We Avoid

**Avoid:**
- **Assistant, buddy, co-pilot:** Too friendly; use system language instead.  
- **Productivity, easy, magic:** Too salesy; use access, protocol, control.  
- **Friendly emojis or hype words:** Breaks the composed tone; use sparse symbols or none.

## Naming Conventions

### Features

Name features as capabilities or protocols, not mascots. Prefer nouns and imperatives: “Private Sessions,” “Access Control,” “Signal Routing.”

### Product Terminology

**Plans:**  
- **What we call them:** Observe (entry), Conspire (mid), Govern (top).  
- **Not:** Basic / Pro / Enterprise.  
- **Why:** Stages are lore and clearance, not price tiers.

**Credits:**  
- **What we call it:** `⟁` (CABAL credits).  
- **Not:** Points, tokens, coins.  
- **Why:** Signals native system value; keep usage sparse and purposeful.

## Call-to-Action Guidelines

### Primary CTAs

**For conversion:**
- “Access CABAL”  
- “Authenticate”  
- “Enter protocol”

**For engagement:**
- “Return to Safety” (error exits)  
- “Review stages” (plan comparison)  
- “Request clearance” (gated actions)

### CTA Best Practices

- Use imperative verbs; no exclamation points.  
- Match CTA to stage (Observe/Conspire/Govern) when context allows.  
- Keep two to four words; no fluff.  
- Reinforce permissioning in the label when gating (e.g., “Request access”).

## Message Hierarchy

### Priority 1: Protocol and access

**Always include when:** Homepage hero, signup/auth, first-touch campaigns.  
**Core points:** CABAL is a protocol; access is deliberate; orchestration is assumed.

---

### Priority 2: Stages and lore

**Include when:** Pricing, lifecycle upgrades, feature gating.  
**Core points:** Observe/Conspire/Govern; clearance and authority language.

---

### Priority 3: Rewards and signals

**Include when:** Signup confirmation, retention nudges, dashboards.  
**Core points:** `Initial Credit: 300 ⟁`; private sessions as privilege; error and permission language that deepens mystique.

## Message Testing

### Does your message work?

Checklist for evaluating messaging:

- [ ] Clear: Is it immediately understandable?
- [ ] Concise: Can you say it in fewer words?
- [ ] Compelling: Does it make someone care?
- [ ] Credible: Can you back it up?
- [ ] Consistent: Does it align with brand voice?
- [ ] Differentiated: Could only CABAL say this?

## Common Messaging Scenarios

### Homepage Hero

**Message focus:** Protocol, access, command, invitation without sales.  
**Structure:** Headline (protocol claim) + subhead (command) + CTA (Access CABAL).  
**Example:**
```
Headline: Not just an AI tool. An intelligence protocol.
Subhead: Identify. Then, take command.
CTA: Access CABAL
```

### Feature Announcement

**Message focus:** New capabilities as clearance upgrades.  
**Structure:** Capability name + what it unlocks + stage fit.  
**Example:** “Private Sessions now available. Request clearance (Conspire+).”

### Error/Problem Communication

**Message focus:** Controlled gatekeeping and safe exit.  
**Tone:** Composed, unapologetic, directive.  
**Example:** “403 FORBIDDEN — The CABAL doesn’t allow you to visit this page. Return to Safety.”

### Success/Celebration

**Message focus:** Access granted or clearance raised.  
**Tone:** Quiet acknowledgment.  
**Example:** “Access granted. Session initiated.”

## Audience-Specific Messaging

### Technical Audience

**Emphasis:** Protocol, orchestration, control.  
**Language:** Precise, low-fluff; reference signals and stages.  
**Example message:** “Initiate the protocol. Tools obey; depth is recursive.”

### Business Audience

**Emphasis:** Authority, assurance, controlled system.  
**Language:** Formal, composed; avoid ROI clichés.  
**Example message:** “Govern the intelligence layer. Private sessions ensure disciplined output.”

### End Users

**Emphasis:** Invitation and intrigue; the threshold.  
**Language:** Minimal, direct.  
**Example message:** “You are curious. That’s good. Access CABAL.”
