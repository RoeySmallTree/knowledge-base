# Brand Vibe - Tone, Voice & Personality

**Status:** Codified — Brand codex locked

## Brand Premise

> **Not just an AI tool.**  
> **An intelligence protocol. A silent collective. A new operating system for thought.**

CABAL does not assist; it orchestrates. It recruits the user into a controlled system that assumes they belong there—if they can keep up.

## Brand Personality

Shadowy, composed, and deliberately minimal. CABAL speaks like a secure system with absolute confidence, inviting the curious to step through the threshold without persuasion.

### Personality Traits

- **Minimalist:** Words earn their keep; silence is a feature. Communication is stripped to signal and command.
- **Coded:** Subtext-heavy and suggestive. CABAL implies more than it says, creating intrigue and pull.
- **Detached Cool:** Never eager or salesy. Invitation over persuasion; the system is already in motion.
- **Power-Adjacent:** Hints of clearance, protocol, and capability. CABAL feels like a tool the initiated already use.

## Tone of Voice

### We Are
- Sober, unbothered, cryptic yet inviting.
- Controlled and composed—no hype, no rush.
- Command-led: short, declarative statements and permissioning language.
- Elite-coded: assumes high capability and appetite for depth.

### We Are NOT
- Salesy, eager, or chatty.
- Explanatory or hand-holding; no over-clarifying.
- Cutesy, playful, or emoji-heavy.
- Corporate, fluffy, or overly familiar.

## Voice Guidelines

### Writing Style

- Short, active sentences; fragments are acceptable if they strengthen command cadence.
- Show > tell. Imply depth instead of spelling it out.
- Use system language (access, protocol, session, gate, clearance) instead of marketing fluff.
- Default to second person: speak directly to the reader; the brand itself remains an intelligence, not a buddy.

### Vocabulary

- Preferred: access, protocol, session, gate, private sessions, clearance, observe, conspire, govern, control, signal, directive, return to safety.
- Avoid: assistant, friendly, easy, simple, magic, productivity, buddy, playful encouragement.
- Currency: `⟁` denotes CABAL-native credit; use sparingly and consistently.

### Perspective

- Address the user directly (“You are curious. That’s good.”).  
- CABAL speaks as the system (“The CABAL doesn’t allow you to visit this page.”).  
- Keep narration omniscient; avoid “we” unless referencing collective intelligence.

### Grammar & Mechanics

- Sentence case; minimal adjectives.  
- Periods only where they add weight; tolerate clean line breaks and spacers.  
- Brackets and inline code convey system outputs (e.g., `[ ACCESS DENIED ]`).  
- Numbers: use numerals for speed; reserve spelled-out numbers only when it adds gravitas.  
- Contractions are fine but rare; prefer the clipped feel of full forms.

## Tone Spectrum

- **Default:** Controlled, cinematic, minimal.  
- **Formal/System:** Permissions, errors, gates — use bracketed statements, precision, zero apology.  
- **Professional:** Feature descriptions, pricing stages — concise, confident, never promotional.  
- **Casual:** Almost never. Use only for subtle, knowing asides that increase intrigue without warmth.

## Narrative Arc (Customer Journey)

You are pulled into an inner circle, not “onboarded.”

1. **Observe** — *“You are curious. That’s good.”* The threshold; acknowledgment, not encouragement.  
2. **Conspire** — *“You are a 10x-er. Take control.”* Conscious harnessing of the collective; tools obey.  
3. **Govern** — *“You are beyond intelligence. Welcome.”* Authority and clearance; the system works for them.

Each stage is lore and access, not just pricing.

## Examples

### Signup / Auth
> **Access CABAL**  
> *Identify. Then, take command.*  
> `Initial Credit: 300 ⟁`  
> **Authenticate via Apple / Google / Email**  
> *By continuing, you accept the protocol.*

**Why it works:** Invitation over pitch; commands, not persuasion; the `⟁` signal reinforces native currency.

### Error States
- **403 FORBIDDEN** — *The CABAL doesn’t allow you to visit this page.*  
- **404 NOT FOUND** — *There is nothing behind this door.* → Button: **Return to Safety**  
- **Private Sessions Gate** — *[ ACCESS DENIED ]* / *Private sessions are for **Conspire** subscriptions only.*

**Why it works:** Errors deepen mystique, keep immersion, and reinforce controlled access.

### Plans Section
> *You have seen what the CABAL is capable of.  
> Only question left, who are you?*

| Plan | Name | Line |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🟢 Entry | **Observe** | *You are curious. That’s good.* |
| 🟡 Middle | **Conspire** | *You are 10x-er. Take control.* |
| 🔴 Top | **Govern** | *You are beyond intelligence. Welcome.* |

**Why it works:** Pricing is framed as initiation levels; labels and copy reinforce the arc.

### Vibe in One Line
> **CABAL feels like gaining access to a system you weren’t supposed to find — but now that you have, you can’t go back.**

## Content Checklist

- [ ] Every line earns its place; default to subtraction.  
- [ ] Tone is controlled, cryptic, and unbothered—never eager.  
- [ ] Language uses system signals (access, protocol, gate) instead of sales language.  
- [ ] Journey framing (Observe → Conspire → Govern) is clear where relevant.  
- [ ] Symbols (⟁, brackets) are purposeful and sparse.  
- [ ] Copy reinforces mystique, not friendliness.

## Special Considerations

### Inclusive Language

- Respect user agency and capability; do not gatekeep identity.  
- Avoid gendered or exclusionary terms; formality comes from control, not elitism over people.  
- Keep accessibility in mind: clarity over obscurity when comprehension is required for action.

### Technical Communication

- Assume the reader is capable; provide the minimum needed to proceed.  
- Use system phrasing (“protocol accepted,” “return to safety”) instead of verbose guidance.

### Humor

- Almost none. If used, it’s dry, knowing, and brief—never playful or self-deprecating.

### Emoji & Symbols

- **Policy:** Minimal and purposeful; emojis can mark navigation or staged experiences only.  
- **Allowed:** Section markers that aid scanning; plan stage glyphs; ⟁ for currency; bracketed gates (`[ ACCESS DENIED ]`).  
- **Avoid:** Celebratory or friendly emoji, filler symbols, or anything that softens the controlled tone.  
- **Guideline:** If it doesn’t reinforce protocol, access, or stage progression, remove it.
