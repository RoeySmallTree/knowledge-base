# Service Boundaries

**Status:** Background for Legal - Updated 2025-12-03

## Purpose

Documents what Cabal guarantees and what it doesn't, for legal review and ToS drafting.

## AI-Generated, Probabilistic Outputs

### Nature of the Technology

Cabal relies on large language models that are:
- **Statistical**: Outputs are based on probability distributions
- **Non-deterministic**: Same input may produce different outputs
- **Sometimes wrong**: Can be factually incorrect, incomplete, biased, or hallucinating

### Implications

- Outputs can be factually incorrect, incomplete, biased, or unsafe if used without review
- The system can surface reasoning and decisions, but they are still generated text
- No guarantee of accuracy, completeness, or fitness for any particular purpose

## What Cabal Is NOT

**Cabal is a decision-support and content-generation tool**, not:

- A legal advisor
- A medical professional
- A financial advisor
- A certified consultant
- A substitute for professional judgment

**Final responsibility always remains with the human user.**

## User Responsibilities

Users are responsible for:

1. **Verification**: Verifying outputs before using them in real-world decisions or publishing
2. **Configuration**: Configuring the system appropriately for their context
3. **Rights**: Ensuring they have the right to upload any content they submit
4. **Compliance**: Ensuring their use of Cabal complies with applicable law and third-party rights

## Platform Limitations

Cabal, as a platform, should be understood as:

### Best-Effort Service

- Best-effort on uptime and availability
- Subject to infrastructure and third-party APIs
- No SLA guarantees unless explicitly contracted

### Platform Rights

The platform reserves the right to:
- Change models, features, and UX over time
- Suspend or terminate accounts in cases of abuse or policy violations
- Run A/B tests and experiments on workflows (while keeping privacy and security in mind)
- Modify pricing and packaging

### ToS Provisions (Typical)

The ToS would typically include:
- Warranty disclaimers
- Limitation of liability
- Indemnity provisions

These are legal drafting questions; this document only describes **the nature of the product**.

## Prohibited Uses

Cabal is not meant to be used for:

- Illegal activities, fraud, or scams
- Harassment, hate content, or abusive behavior
- Generation or dissemination of malware
- Attempts to reverse-engineer or abuse LLM providers
- Circumvention of safety measures
- Generation of content that violates third-party rights

The actual policy list will appear in ToS / AUP (Acceptable Use Policy).
