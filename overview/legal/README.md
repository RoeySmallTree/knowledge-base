# Legal & Compliance Context

**Status:** Background for Legal Review

## Purpose

This section provides background information for legal counsel drafting Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, and other legal documents.

**Important:** This is NOT legal documentation itself. It describes:
- How the system behaves
- What data it handles
- Service boundaries and responsibilities
- IP considerations

## Navigation

- [Data & Privacy](./data-and-privacy.md) - Data model, third-party processing, retention
- [Service Boundaries](./service-boundaries.md) - What Cabal guarantees and doesn't
- [IP & Ownership](./ip-and-ownership.md) - Conceptual IP framework

## Audience

- Legal counsel drafting ToS/Privacy Policy
- Compliance officers
- Security reviewers
- Enterprise procurement teams

## Key Points for Legal

1. **Third-party LLM processing**: User content is transmitted to external LLM providers
2. **AI-generated outputs**: Probabilistic, non-deterministic, may be wrong
3. **User responsibility**: Users must verify outputs before use
4. **Data retention**: Session data is stored for user access and debugging
5. **IP model**: User owns inputs; outputs are licensed for user's use
