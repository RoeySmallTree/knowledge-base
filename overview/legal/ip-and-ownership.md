# IP & Ownership

**Status:** Background for Legal - Updated 2025-12-03

## Purpose

Conceptual framing for intellectual property and ownership, for legal review and ToS drafting.

**Note:** This describes how IP usually works for such a product; final decisions belong in the ToS.

## User Content (Inputs)

### Ownership

- **Inputs** (prompts, uploads) are user content
- They generally remain the property of the user / workspace owner

### License to Platform

The service requires a license to:
- Host, copy, and process inputs
- Transmit them to third-party LLM providers
- Store them in logs and backups as necessary to provide the service

This is typically a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license limited to service provision.

## Generated Content (Outputs)

### Nature of Outputs

**Outputs** (drafts, final products) are generated with a mix of:
- User content
- Model behavior
- System prompts and orchestration

### Typical SaaS Patterns

Users typically receive broad rights to use outputs for their purposes:
- Commercial use
- Modification
- Distribution
- No attribution required (unless otherwise specified)

The platform typically retains a limited license to:
- Store and process outputs
- Use them for debugging and operating the service
- Potentially use for improving the service (policy decision)

## Platform IP

### Cabal's IP

The platform owns IP in:
- The orchestration system
- Agent prompts and personas
- User interface and experience
- Documentation and branding
- Technical implementation

### User Cannot Claim

Users cannot claim ownership of:
- The Cabal system or any part of it
- Agent behavior or prompts
- System-generated structure or formatting

## Policy Decision: Training & Improvement

The exact stance on **using customer content to improve the product** is a policy decision:

**Options:**
1. **No training**: Customer content never used for model training
2. **Opt-in training**: Only with explicit consent
3. **Aggregate analytics**: Anonymized usage patterns only
4. **Full use**: Reserved right to use (less common for enterprise)

This document does not fix the policy; it only surfaces that it must be addressed clearly in legal terms.

## Third-Party Content

### User Warranties

Users should warrant that:
- They have rights to content they upload
- Content doesn't infringe third-party IP
- Content complies with applicable laws

### Platform Position

The platform typically:
- Does not pre-screen content
- Responds to valid takedown notices
- Reserves right to remove infringing content
- May terminate repeat infringers
