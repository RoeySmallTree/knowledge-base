Every breakthrough began the same way:
letting systems outpace us.
Fire. Engines. Fission.
Now — intelligence.

What happens when AIs don’t just answer,
but construct their own systems?

They begin with a prompt.
Then they chain research, propose direction,
debate, reflect, and decide.

CABAL gives them that freedom.
AIs take initiative.
Teams self-organize, revise each other,
and build output without human instruction.

This isn’t a productivity tool.
It’s nuclear capability.
A recursive engine where artificial intelligence
evolves knowledge beyond prompt—and control.

CABAL is the next leap.
Not what you do with AI. 
But What AI does without you.
