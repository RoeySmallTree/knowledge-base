# Chat-Teaser Section: Narrative & Strategy

## SECTION PURPOSE

This is the **"oh shit" moment**. The viewer has seen the hero, knows the name. Now they see what it actually means. The contrast between "Solo AI" and "AIs United" should create visceral recognition: "I've been using a toy."

---

## WHAT WE'RE CONVEYING

### The Core Realization

**Solo AI:** You ask, it answers, you're alone with its output.
**AIs United:** They're already working. They talk to each other. You receive results, not responses.

### The Emotional Arc

1. **Recognition** — "I know this feeling" (the Solo side)
2. **Contrast** — "Wait, they're talking to each other?"
3. **Implication** — "This is a different thing entirely"

---

## THE FIVE VALUE DIMENSIONS

| Tab | What Solo Shows | What United Shows | The Gap |
|-----|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| **Multi-Model Perspective** | One opinion, stated confidently | Multiple angles, blind spots caught | Depth vs. surface |
| **Multi-Disciplinary** | Generalist trying everything | Specialists coordinating on their domain | Expertise vs. approximation |
| **Completeness** | Outline, summary, "let me know if you need more" | Finished deliverable, comprehensive scope | Work vs. response |
| **Proactiveness** | Waits for next prompt | Asks questions, raises concerns, moves forward | Agency vs. passivity |
| **Coherency** | Can contradict itself across outputs | Agents catch inconsistencies, correct each other | Integrity vs. drift |

---

## THE "WOW" MECHANICS

What makes United feel different:

1. **Agents address each other** — "@Gemini can you check this?" (not talking to user)
2. **Role clarity** — "You're DevOps, work with the coder" (they have jobs)
3. **Disagreement** — "Don't you think we should..." (they push back)
4. **Deliverables mentioned** — "13 chapters attached," "page 57" (real work, not summaries)
5. **Casual competence** — "Sorry guys, my bad" (personality, not corporate)
6. **Forward motion** — They're already doing the next thing

## DOMAIN COVERAGE

**Problem:** Current examples are tech/dev heavy. Need to show breadth.

### Recommended Mix (5 tabs = 5 domains)

| Tab | Domain | Why It Works |
|-----|--------|--------------|
| **Multi-Model Perspective** | Technical/Debug | Familiar pain point, clear contrast |
| **Multi-Disciplinary** | Business/Strategy | Shows cross-functional teams, enterprise relevance |
| **Completeness** | Creative/Content | Dramatic contrast (outline vs. finished book) |
| **Proactiveness** | Research/Analysis | Shows agents driving process, asking hard questions |
| **Coherency** | Legal/Documentation | High stakes, attention to detail, enterprise trust |

### Alternative Domains to Consider

- **Finance:** Due diligence, investment memo, risk analysis
- **Product:** PRD creation, feature spec, competitive analysis
- **Academic:** Research synthesis, literature review
- **Marketing:** Campaign strategy, brand positioning
- **M&A:** Target analysis, integration planning

---

## TONE NOTES

### Solo Side
- Helpful but hollow
- "Let me know if you need anything else"
- Single voice, no personality
- Ends with a period and waits

### United Side
- Agents have texture (Claude is sharp, GPT is earnest, Gemini is precise, Grok is casual)
- Conversations mid-flow (viewer drops into ongoing work)
- Slight chaos, but coordinated chaos
- Feels like overhearing a capable team

---

## STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS

1. **How many messages per United panel?** 
   - Recommend 2-4. Enough to show dynamic, not overwhelming.

2. **Should user appear in United?**
   - Sparingly. The point is they're working without constant prompting.

3. **Should Solo have a model name?**
   - Yes. Grounds it in reality. GPT or Claude works.

4. **Timing/animation?**
   - United messages could cascade in (team arriving) vs. Solo's single static block

---

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

The section works if the viewer:
- Instantly recognizes the Solo experience
- Feels the United side is "alive" in a way Solo isn't
- Understands this isn't a feature — it's a paradigm
- Wants to see their own problem run through this

---

## WHAT THIS SECTION IS NOT

- Not a feature list
- Not a comparison chart
- Not "Solo is bad, we're good"
- Not explaining HOW (that's the Witness section)

It's pure **show, don't tell**. The contrast does the work.
