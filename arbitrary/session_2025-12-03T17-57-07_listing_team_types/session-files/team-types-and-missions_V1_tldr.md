**TLDR:**

This document proposes four example team structures for the CABAL system:
1.  **Core Development Team:** Builds and maintains the system.
2.  **Research & Analysis Team:** Explores ideas and analyzes data.
3.  **Content Generation Team:** Produces documentation and other content.
4.  **Protocol & Governance Team:** Manages project standards and protocols.

Each team is composed of an Orchestrator and various Specialists, assembled dynamically for a specific mission.

**ELI5:**

Imagine you have a big project. Instead of one person doing everything, you build a team of experts.
*   A "Building Team" to create new things.
*   A "Detective Team" to research and find information.
*   A "Writing Team" to explain how things work.
*   A "Rules Team" to make sure everyone works together nicely.

A manager (the Orchestrator) picks the right experts for the job and makes sure they work together to get it done.
