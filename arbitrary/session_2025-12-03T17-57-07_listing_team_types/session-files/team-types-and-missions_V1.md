# Team Types and Missions v1

This document outlines potential team structures within the CABAL framework, aligning agent roles to specific mission objectives. These teams are dynamic and can be assembled by the Orchestrator based on the user's high-level goal.

## 1. Core Development Team

This team is responsible for building, maintaining, and improving the CABAL system itself, including its core logic, agent capabilities, and underlying infrastructure.

**Mission:** "Build and deploy a new feature for sentiment analysis."

**Team Composition:**

*   **Orchestrator (Lead):** Manages the project, breaks down the mission into tasks, and coordinates the specialists.
*   **Architect (Specialist):** Designs the overall software architecture for the new feature, ensuring it integrates with the existing system.
*   **Implementer (Specialist):** Writes the core Python/TypeScript code for the sentiment analysis model and its API endpoints.
*   **Tester (Specialist):** Writes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests to ensure the feature is robust and bug-free.
*   **Documenter (Specialist):** Writes developer and user documentation for the new feature.

## 2. Research & Analysis Team

This team is focused on exploring new ideas, analyzing data, and providing insights to inform strategic decisions.

**Mission:** "Analyze market trends for AI-powered developer tools and produce a competitive analysis report."

**Team Composition:**

*   **Orchestrator (Lead):** Defines the research scope, assigns areas of investigation, and synthesizes the final report.
*   **Analyst (Specialist):** Gathers data from various sources (e.g., web searches, market reports), identifies key competitors, and analyzes their strengths and weaknesses.
*   **Data Scientist (Specialist):** Processes and visualizes quantitative data to identify market trends and opportunities.
*   **Strategist (Specialist):** Interprets the analysis and provides strategic recommendations.

## 3. Content Generation Team

This team is designed to produce creative and technical content, such as documentation, articles, or marketing materials.

**Mission:** "Write a comprehensive tutorial on how to use the new sentiment analysis feature."

**Team Composition:**

*   **Orchestrator (Lead):** Outlines the tutorial structure, assigns sections to writers, and ensures a consistent tone and style.
*   **Technical Writer (Specialist):** Writes the main body of the tutorial, including code examples and step-by-step instructions.
*   **Editor (Specialist):** Reviews and edits the content for clarity, grammar, and accuracy.
*   **Publisher (Specialist):** Formats the tutorial for the web and publishes it to the documentation website.

## 4. Protocol & Governance Team

This internal-facing team focuses on maintaining the project's standards, protocols, and operational procedures.

**Mission:** "Create and apply a new protocol directive to enforce conventional commits."

**Team Composition:**

*   **Orchestrator (Lead):** Oversees the process of creating, reviewing, and applying the new directive.
*   **Protocol Officer (Specialist):** Drafts the `//directive` based on the requirements, including the changes to `protocol/rules.md` and `protocol/commands.md`.
*   **Auditor (Specialist):** Reviews past commits to assess the impact of the new rule and validates that the directive is applied correctly.
*   **Implementer (Specialist):** Executes the directive, applying the necessary changes to the repository.

These team structures are flexible. The Orchestrator can mix and match roles from different domains to create custom teams tailored to any given mission.
