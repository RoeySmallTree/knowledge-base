# TLDR: V4_features_bullets.md

## ELI5
We made it sound cool and mysterious. Short punchy sentences. Fragments. Less explaining, more implying.

## Summary
V4 uses evocative, fragment-heavy language per brand vibe.
- **Short versions**: Punchy imperatives and declarations.
- **Long versions**: Evocative but still information-dense.
- **No "you" or "we"**: Strict 3rd person.
