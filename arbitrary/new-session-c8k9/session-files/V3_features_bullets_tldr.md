# TLDR: V3_features_bullets.md

## ELI5
We rewrote the features again. This time, the text never says "you" or "we". It talks about "the system" and "the protocol" like it's describing something powerful and mysterious.

## Summary
Rewrote `V3_features_bullets.md` in strict **3rd person voice** with an enticing, mysterious tone.
- **No "you" or "we"**: All references are to "the system", "the protocol", "agents".
- **Incorporated raw values**: DoD, policy checks, product trees, citations, real-time visibility, etc.
- **Structure**: Retained Short/Long split.
