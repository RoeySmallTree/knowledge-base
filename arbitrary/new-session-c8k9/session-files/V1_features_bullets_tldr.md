## ELI5
We listed the 5 main features of Cabal. For each one, we gave a short catchy title, a one-line summary, and then a paragraph explaining why it's cool.

## Summary
Defined the 5 core value props with rigid formatting:

3. **Chain of Custody**: "Full control. Total traceability."
4. **Protocol Enforcement**: "Robust process, deterministic output."
5. **Recursive Governance**: "Next-generation interaction."
