# TLDR: V1_landing_page_copy.md

## ELI5
We rewrote the landing page text to sound like a cool, powerful computer system instead of a regular sales pitch. It explains that Cabal connects many AIs together to do big work, keeps track of everything, and lets you be the boss of the system.

## Summary
Refined the raw landing page copy to align with the **Cabal Brand Vibe** (Shadowy, Composed, Protocol-led).
- **Rolling Pitch**: Emphasizes "Nuclear Capability" and "Recursive Collaboration".
- **Federated Intelligence**: Focuses on "Model Agnostic" and "Best of Breed".
- **The Collective**: Focuses on "Unified Surface" and "Hierarchical Ownership".
- **Chain of Custody**: Focuses on "Traceability" and "Audit-Readiness".
- **Protocol Enforcement**: Focuses on "Deterministic Output" and "Scale".
- **Recursive Governance**: Focuses on "Multidisciplinary" and "Meritocratic" mechanics.

## Key Changes
- Renamed "Best of breed" to **Federated Intelligence**.
- Renamed "llm-first collaboration" to **The Collective**.
- Renamed "full control" to **Chain of Custody**.
- Renamed "robust process" to **Protocol Enforcement**.
- **Tone Shift**: Removed generic "solution" language; inserted "system/protocol" language.
