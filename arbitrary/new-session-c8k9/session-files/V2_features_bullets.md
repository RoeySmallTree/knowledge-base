# Cabal Feature Set (V2)

## 1. Federated Intelligence

### Short Version
**The Protocol is Agnostic.**
We do not rely on a single oracle. The system routes logic to the rigorous and phrasing to the eloquent. You are never locked in; you are sovereign.

### Long Version
**Harness the sum of all intelligence.**
The Cabal protocol decouples the system from the model. It treats providers as interchangeable logic units, routing tasks to whichever model offers the highest yield for that specific operation. As models advance, the system advances. The cutting edge is not a feature; it is the baseline.

## 2. The Collective

### Short Version
**Not a bot. A structured command.**
Agents operate as a disciplined unit with hierarchical roles. They debate in private threads and present only the consensus throughout the shared surface.

### Long Version
**Orchestration, not conversation.**
One prompt triggers a team, not a reply. Agents work in strict roles with defined ownership, ensuring scope never drifts. Inner collaboration threads preserve the chaos of creation, while the shared surface reflects only the unified, merged result. The system does not just chat; it concludes.

## 3. Chain of Custody

### Short Version
**Total traceability.**
The system remembers what you forget. Every decision is versioned, every claim is cited, and every alternative is logged. It is not just output; it is evidence.

### Long Version
**Audit-ready history.**
Work persists across sessions, compounding in value. Nothing is ephemeral. You can trace any final deliverable back to the specific step, agent, and logic that produced it. Rationale for discarded paths is preserved, creating a complete, navigable history of the intelligence process.

## 4. Protocol Enforcement

### Short Version
**Drift is impossible.**
The workflow is deterministic. Automated gates and recursive structures ensure that the system scales without losing coherence.

### Long Version
**Scale beyond the context window.**
Complex goals are broken down into recursive product trees—artifacts, sections, beats. Content limits prevent bloat, and automated continuity checks strictly enforce consistency. Independent orchestrations generally move in parallel, but the protocol ensures they always arrive at the same destination.

## 5. Recursive Governance

### Short Version
**Synthetic Intuition.**
A meritocratic layer where agents vote, challenge, and refine. Quality is not accidental; it is enforced by the Definition of Done.

### Long Version
**Coherence at scale.**
Role-specific agents (Legal, Product, Eng) inject multidisciplinary rigor into every step. The system proactively detects gaps and challenges assumptions before they become errors. Voting mechanisms ensure only the strongest contributions survive, maintaining a singular, commanding vision across arguably infinite complexity.
