# Cabal Feature Set (V3)

## 1. Federated Intelligence

### Short Version
**The sum of all models.**
No single oracle. Logic routes to the rigorous, phrasing to the eloquent. The system advances as the models do—always the cutting edge.

### Long Version
**A model-agnostic protocol. No vendor lock-in.**
The collective baseline is drawn from all providers. Each task routes to the model best suited for it: phrasing to the eloquent, logic to the rigorous, research to the relentless. Keys and vendors mix freely. As the underlying models advance, so does the system. It is not a product that ages; it is a protocol that evolves.

## 2. The Collective

### Short Version
**Structured teams. Unified output.**
Agents operate as a disciplined unit with defined roles. Outputs are debated, challenged, and merged into a single, inspectable result.

### Long Version
**Orchestration, not conversation.**
A single surface reveals state, decisions, and artifacts. Shared, persistent memory captures decisions, context, and rationale across sessions. Inner per-node collaboration threads preserve local discussions, while hierarchical ownership and gates keep direction and scope aligned. Multiple agents per role compete; only the strongest contributions are fused into the final result.

## 3. Chain of Custody

### Short Version
**Full traceability.**
Every deliverable traces back to its contributing steps. Every decision is versioned. Nothing is lost.

### Long Version
**Audit-ready history.**
Any deliverable can be back-traced to every step, reason, and reference that produced it. Rationale for discarded options is preserved for learning. Versioning with diffs, changelogs, and reflections at each step creates a navigable record. Citations support every claim. Work can pause, resume, and compound. Real-time visibility into status, blockers, and outputs ensures nothing escapes notice.

## 4. Protocol Enforcement

### Short Version
**Deterministic workflow. No drift.**
Recursive structures organize complex goals. Automated gates and continuity checks scale work beyond context windows without losing coherence.

### Long Version
**Scale without decay.**
Content limits per component prevent bloat or underspec. Exit criteria and review gates are configurable. Automated detection of edge cases and continuity gaps enforces consistency. Product trees make large projects durable and navigable, organizing goals → artifacts → sections → beats. Collections extend the context frame. Parallelization increases throughput while staying aligned. Cross-referencing between data nodes remains backward-compatible.

## 5. Recursive Governance

### Short Version
**Synthetic intuition.**
Multidisciplinary agents vote and merge. Quality is held by DoD, reviewers, and policy checks.

### Long Version
**Coherence at scale.**
Role-specific perspectives (legal, product, engineering) inject multidisciplinary rigor. Voting and merging mechanisms select only the strongest contributions. Independent orchestrations allow parallel progress on sub-nodes. Proactive agents ask for missing info and challenge assumptions. Role assignment and guardrails cut contradictory behavior. A coherent vision is maintained across large, long-running projects.
