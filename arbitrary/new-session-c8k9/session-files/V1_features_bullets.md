# Cabal Feature Set

## Federated Intelligence
**Best of breed. No lock-in.**
The baseline is the sum of all models. We harness the specific strengths of each provider—routing phrasing tasks to one, logic to another, research to a third. You are never locked in. As the models advance, so does the system. It is, by definition, the cutting edge.

## The Collective
**LLM-first orchestration.**
Agents operate as a structured team, not a chat bot. Inner threads preserve local discussions, while the single shared surface presents the unified result. Outputs are debated, challenged, and merged. Hierarchical ownership keeps direction aligned, ensuring that every agent knows its role and its bounds.

## Chain of Custody
**Full control. Total traceability.**
Nothing is lost. Work can pause, resume, and compound across sessions. Real-time visibility into status and blockers ensures you are never out of the loop. Every step, reason, and alternative is logged. It is not just output; it is evidence.

## Protocol Enforcement
**Robust process, deterministic output.**
Content limits prevent bloat. Recursive structures organize goals into artifacts, sections, and beats, ensuring that even large projects remain navigable. The workflow is deterministic and repeatable, reducing drift and enforcing consistency. Collections allow context to extend without losing structure.

## Recursive Governance
**Next-generation interaction.**
Quality is held by the Definition of Done. Independent orchestrations allow parallel progress on sub-nodes, while role assignment cuts contradictory behavior. The system proactively detects missing information and ensures a coherent vision is maintained across long-running projects.
