# Cabal Feature Set (V4)

## 1. Federated Intelligence

### Short
**No single oracle.**
Logic routes to the rigorous. Phrasing to the eloquent. The baseline is the sum of all minds.

### Long
**The collective never ages.**
No vendor owns the protocol. Keys and models mix freely. Each task finds its natural executor—phrasing to the eloquent, logic to the rigorous, research to the relentless. As one model advances, the whole advances. The cutting edge is not a version number. It is the default state.

## 2. The Collective

### Short
**Debate. Merge. Conclude.**
Agents compete in private. Only the fused result surfaces.

### Long
**A team that never forgets.**
State, decisions, and artifacts live on a single inspectable surface. Persistent memory carries rationale across sessions. Inner threads preserve the chaos of creation; the shared surface reflects only consensus. Hierarchical gates keep scope from drifting. Multiple agents per role—only the strongest survive the merge.

## 3. Chain of Custody

### Short
**Nothing is ephemeral.**
Every step logged. Every claim cited. Every path—taken or discarded—preserved.

### Long
**The system remembers what others forget.**
Any deliverable traces back to every contributing step, reason, and reference. Discarded paths are not deleted; they become lessons. Versioning with diffs, changelogs, and reflections at each step. Citations anchor every claim. Work pauses, resumes, compounds. Real-time visibility into status and blockers. It is not output. It is evidence.

## 4. Protocol Enforcement

### Short
**Drift is impossible.**
Recursive structures. Automated gates. Continuity checks. The workflow is deterministic.

### Long
**Scale without decay.**
Content limits prevent bloat. Exit criteria and review gates are configurable per node. Automated detection of edge cases and continuity gaps. Product trees organize goals → artifacts → sections → beats. Collections extend the context frame without losing structure. Parallelization increases throughput. Cross-referencing remains backward-compatible. Contradictions are caught. Consistency is enforced.

## 5. Recursive Governance

### Short
**Quality is not optional.**
Multidisciplinary agents vote. Merging selects only the strongest. DoD holds the line.

### Long
**Coherence at scale.**
Role-specific perspectives—legal, product, engineering—inject multidisciplinary rigor. Voting and merging mechanisms select only the strongest contributions. Independent orchestrations allow parallel progress. Proactive agents ask for missing info, challenge assumptions. Role assignment and guardrails cut contradictory behavior. A singular vision persists across complexity.
