# TLDR: V2_features_bullets.md

## ELI5
We rewrote the list of features again. Now it sounds much more serious and cool, like a secret powerful computer system. We still have the short and long versions for each point.

## Summary
Refined `V2_features_bullets.md` to strictly follow the **Cabal Brand Vibe** (Shadowy, Composed, System-led).
- **Voice**: Used authoritative, clipped sentences ("Drift is impossible", "The Protocol is Agnostic").
- **Language**: Swapped marketing terms for system terms (Oracle, Command, Soverign, Evidence).
- **Structure**: Maintained the requested Short/Long split.
