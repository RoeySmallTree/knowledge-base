# Cabal-Friendly Teams & Missions (V1)

## Purpose
Quick reference on which teams get the most value from Cabal and the missions they should run through the multi-agent workflow.

## Teams & Mission Patterns

### Strategic leadership pods (founders, PMs, chiefs of staff)
- Why Cabal fits: Turns fuzzy strategy into a mission with objectives, options, and decision records the exec team can replay.
- Mission patterns:
  - Convert a product thesis into a mission with objectives, success metrics, and risks.
  - Build a quarterly initiative map with options and decision nodes that capture trade-offs.
  - Create an executive briefing that compares strategic paths with rationale and next steps.

### Research & analysis cells (consultants, analysts)
- Why Cabal fits: Coordinates parallel research, synthesis, and critique with audit trails and citations.
- Mission patterns:
  - Multi-source market/competitor brief with synthesized insights and option sets.
  - Policy or risk briefing that captures scenarios, mitigations, and a decision record.
  - Opportunity scan that ranks plays with evidence and confidence levels.

### Product & GTM squads (PMM, marketing, revops)
- Why Cabal fits: Produces multi-part launch plans, message maps, and campaign blueprints with built-in QA.
- Mission patterns:
  - Go-to-market plan for a new product/feature: positioning, segments, channels, launch milestones.
  - Messaging hierarchy and content kit (narrative, proofs, objections) with variations by audience.
  - Campaign or ABM playbook with options, scoring, and a recommended path.

### Technical planning teams (eng leads, architects, QA leads)
- Why Cabal fits: Generates structured technical plans (not code execution) with decision trails and test coverage.
- Mission patterns:
  - Architecture or refactor plan that stages milestones, risks, and fallback options.
  - Test strategy/regression plan with coverage map, owner assignments, and exit criteria.
  - Runbook for an initiative (migration, reliability hardening) with sequencing and checkpoints.

### Agencies & studios (strategy, creative, content pods)
- Why Cabal fits: Scales repeatable, client-ready deliverables with consistency and transparent rationale.
- Mission patterns:
  - Integrated campaign blueprint with concept options, channel mix, and production plan.
  - Brand or content playbook with pillars, tone, examples, and governance rules.
  - Client review packet that compares scenarios and provides a recommended direction with rationale.

## Notes
- Cabal is strongest on structured, multi-section text outputs with options, decisions, and rationale; not for code execution.
- Missions land best when they expect iteration: plan → review → refinement, with the Watchdog enforcing structure.
