# Thematic Teams & Missions — TLDR (V1)

**TLDR:** Ready-made Cabal team setups: (1) Legal case squad with interns, prosecutor/defense, evidence lead, and Harvard-style debate rounds; (2) MIT-rigorous academic cell for causality/correlation and foresight studies; (3) Market analyst pod for public equity theses and post-mortems; (4) Startup strike team with CEO/CTO/design/eng/ops/marketing to craft disruption blueprints and launch plans.

**ELI5:** We built four pre-made AI teams: a courtroom crew to argue both sides, a strict research lab, stock-market detectives, and a startup-building squad. Each has the right specialists and rules so they can tackle cases, studies, investments, or new-company plans with solid structure.
