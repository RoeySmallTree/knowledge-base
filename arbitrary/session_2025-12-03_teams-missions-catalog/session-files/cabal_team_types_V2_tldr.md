# Cabal-Friendly Teams & Missions — TLDR (V2)

**TLDR:** Cabal fits teams that need structured, multi-section deliverables with options and rationale: strategy pods, research/analysis cells, product & GTM squads, technical planners, agencies/studios—plus security/incident pods, compliance/regulatory responders, and customer success/support crews.

**ELI5:** Cabal is like a smart writing room full of specialists. It’s best when leaders, researchers, marketers, architects, agencies, security/compliance folks, or customer success teams need clear plans, playbooks, or reports with choices and reasons spelled out.
