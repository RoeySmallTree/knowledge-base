# Cabal-Friendly Teams & Missions — TLDR (V1)

**TLDR:** Cabal is best for teams that need structured, multi-part text deliverables with options, decisions, and rationale: strategic leadership pods, research/analysis cells, product & GTM squads, technical planning teams (plans/test strategies—not code), and agencies/studios delivering client-ready playbooks.

**ELI5:** Cabal is like a smart project team made of AIs. It shines when a group needs plans, research summaries, or launch playbooks—things with sections, options, and reasons—so leaders, researchers, product/marketing crews, tech planners, and agencies all get strong outputs fast.
