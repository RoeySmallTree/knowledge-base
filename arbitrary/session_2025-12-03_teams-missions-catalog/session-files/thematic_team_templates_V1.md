# Thematic Teams & Missions (V1)

## Purpose
Concrete Cabal team setups with personas, standards, and ready-to-run missions for specific domains (legal, debate, academic research, market analysis, startup building).

## 1) Legal Case Team — Evidence + Adversarial Debate
- Composition:
  - Chair: Senior litigator (10+ yrs) orchestrating scope, theory of case, and deliverables.
  - Operatives:
    - Prosecutor (7+ yrs, trial focus).
    - Defense counsel (7+ yrs, trial/appellate awareness).
    - Evidence lead (3+ yrs, e-discovery, chain-of-custody rigor).
    - Two research interns (source gathering, cite-checking, timeline reconstruction).
  - Watchdog: Compliance & citation auditor (ensures evidentiary standards, structure, ethics).
  - Envoy: Client-facing liaison to surface clarifications and summarize.
- Standards: Harvard debate rigor for adversarial rounds; formal cite discipline (Bluebook-like); timeline + fact matrix mandatory.
- Missions:
  - Case reconstruction (car crash): migrant woman, limited language, incomplete incident details. Deliver: timeline, fact matrix, liability options, evidentiary gaps, recommended motions.
  - Adversarial debate: climate change legitimacy (false cause vs valid science). Split into Team A (prosecution/claimant) and Team B (defense/skeptic). Each runs:
    - Constructive (claims + cites), rebuttal, cross-exam questions, closing; Watchdog enforces burden/logic.
- Outputs: Timeline, fact matrix, argument map, motions list, risk/likelihood table, closing statements from both sides, Watchdog validation report.

## 2) Academic Research Cell — MIT-Style Rigor
- Composition:
  - Chair: Principal investigator (PI) setting research question and standards.
  - Operatives: Methods lead, literature review lead, data analyst/forecaster, domain ethicist, two research associates for citation sweeps.
  - Watchdog: Methodology & reproducibility auditor (checks statistical validity, sourcing, bias notes).
  - Envoy: Summarizes for non-technical stakeholders.
- Standards: MIT research posture; explicit methodology, assumptions, limitations; citation stack; reproducibility notes.
- Missions:
  - Correlation between religiosity and crime: hypotheses, dataset plan, confounders, causal caveats, policy implications.
  - Impact of AI on agricultural industry with forward-looking scenarios: current-state map, technology vectors, 3–5 year forecasts with probabilities, risk/benefit table.
- Outputs: Research question, lit review summary, hypothesis set, methods plan, data needs, findings (or plan), scenario models, limitations, next steps.

## 3) Market/Investment Analyst Pod — Public Equities
- Composition:
  - Chair: Lead analyst guiding thesis shape and diligence gates.
  - Operatives: Sector specialist, macro/FX risk lead, valuation modeler, forensic/accounting reviewer, sentiment/flow analyst.
  - Watchdog: Risk & compliance reviewer (flags weak theses, overreach, missing disclosures).
  - Envoy: Converts findings to exec/IC-ready summary.
- Standards: Investment memo discipline; explicit theses, catalysts, bear/bull cases, risk factors.
- Missions:
  - Company deep dive: "Given <company>, surface leverageable opportunities now, reliability of the stock, catalysts, and red flags." Deliver bull/bear, catalysts, KPIs to monitor.
  - Post-mortem: "Given <investment>, explain outcome drivers and what we missed; update playbook." Include factor attributions and lessons.
- Outputs: One-page thesis, catalyst map, valuation snapshot (inputs/assumptions), risk register, IC memo, monitor list.

## 4) Startup Blueprint Strike Team
- Composition:
  - Chair: CEO (mission/vision, sequencing, trade-offs).
  - Operatives: CTO/architect, FE dev, BE dev, DevOps/SRE, product designer, QA lead, marketing/growth lead, finance/ops lead.
  - Watchdog: Feasibility & dependency auditor (scope realism, risk gates, DoD for each track).
  - Envoy: Investor/client-facing narration and checkpoints.
- Standards: Cohesive business + product + tech alignment; shipping roadmap with risks and owners.
- Missions:
  - Industry disruption blueprint: build a viable company plan to disrupt <industry>; deliver business model, product wedge, tech blueprint, GTM, hiring phases, milestone map.
  - Launch plan: MVP definition, architecture diagram, sequencing (sprint 0/1/2), QA gates, marketing narrative and channels.
- Outputs: Vision + thesis, product spec outline, architecture sketch, delivery plan (milestones/owners), GTM plan, hiring/ops plan, risk/mitigation table, success metrics.

## Usage Notes
- Keep Cabal roles mapped: Chair (mission), Operatives (specialists), Watchdog (quality/standards), Envoy (user-facing). Split into adversarial subteams where debate strengthens the output.
- Require structured outputs: sections, options, decisions, rationale, and Watchdog validation per mission.
