# Cabal-Friendly Teams & Missions (V3)

## Purpose
Reference for teams that gain the most from Cabal’s structured, multi-section outputs. Expanded to cover finance, people ops, supply chain, data governance, and public affairs scenarios in addition to earlier strategy, research, GTM, technical, agency, security, compliance, and CS/support teams.

## Teams & Mission Patterns

### Strategic leadership pods (founders, PMs, chiefs of staff)
- Why Cabal fits: Turns fuzzy strategy into a mission with objectives, options, and decision records the exec team can replay.
- Mission patterns:
  - Convert a product thesis into a mission with objectives, success metrics, and risks.
  - Build a quarterly initiative map with options and decision nodes that capture trade-offs.
  - Create an executive briefing that compares strategic paths with rationale and next steps.

### Research & analysis cells (consultants, analysts)
- Why Cabal fits: Coordinates parallel research, synthesis, and critique with audit trails and citations.
- Mission patterns:
  - Multi-source market/competitor brief with synthesized insights and option sets.
  - Policy or risk briefing that captures scenarios, mitigations, and a decision record.
  - Opportunity scan that ranks plays with evidence and confidence levels.

### Product & GTM squads (PMM, marketing, revops)
- Why Cabal fits: Produces multi-part launch plans, message maps, and campaign blueprints with built-in QA.
- Mission patterns:
  - Go-to-market plan for a new product/feature: positioning, segments, channels, launch milestones.
  - Messaging hierarchy and content kit (narrative, proofs, objections) with variations by audience.
  - Campaign or ABM playbook with options, scoring, and a recommended path.

### Technical planning teams (eng leads, architects, QA leads)
- Why Cabal fits: Generates structured technical plans (not code execution) with decision trails and test coverage.
- Mission patterns:
  - Architecture or refactor plan that stages milestones, risks, and fallback options.
  - Test strategy/regression plan with coverage map, owner assignments, and exit criteria.
  - Runbook for an initiative (migration, reliability hardening) with sequencing and checkpoints.

### Agencies & studios (strategy, creative, content pods)
- Why Cabal fits: Scales repeatable, client-ready deliverables with consistency and transparent rationale.
- Mission patterns:
  - Integrated campaign blueprint with concept options, channel mix, and production plan.
  - Brand or content playbook with pillars, tone, examples, and governance rules.
  - Client review packet that compares scenarios and provides a recommended direction with rationale.

### Security & incident response pods (security leads, SREs, comms)
- Why Cabal fits: Structures incident narratives, root causes, remediation options, and stakeholder messaging with auditable rationale.
- Mission patterns:
  - Incident retrospective: timeline, contributing factors, controls assessment, remediation plan, and executive FAQ.
  - Security hardening plan for a surface area (auth, data, infra): threat model, gaps, options, and staged rollout.
  - Vendor/app risk assessment: evidence review, scoring rubric, compensating controls, and decision memo.

### Compliance & regulatory response teams (compliance, policy, legal)
- Why Cabal fits: Organizes fact patterns, citations, obligations, and response options with clear ownership and approvals.
- Mission patterns:
  - Regulator response packet: summarize facts, map to rules, propose commitments, and track evidence.
  - Policy/guideline rewrite: align controls to a framework (e.g., SOC 2, HIPAA), with change log and training notes.
  - Audit readiness kit: control inventory, tests of effectiveness, gap list, and remediation sequencing.

### Customer success & support excellence crews (CS leaders, ops, enablement)
- Why Cabal fits: Turns scattered product/support knowledge into structured playbooks, RCAs, and enablement kits with feedback loops.
- Mission patterns:
  - Top-ticket RCA and prevention plan: classify drivers, root cause chains, fixes, macros, and success metrics.
  - Feature adoption/onboarding kit: audience-specific guides, checklists, objection handling, and success signals.
  - Renewal/risk playbook: churn signals, save motions, talk tracks, proof points, and escalation paths.

### Finance & FP&A crews (CFO staff, FP&A leads)
- Why Cabal fits: Produces traceable planning narratives, scenario trees, and board-ready packs with assumptions and sensitivities.
- Mission patterns:
  - Board pack draft: KPIs, variance analysis, cash/ runway scenarios, risks, and asks; include option trees for cuts vs growth bets.
  - Annual/quarterly planning memo: drivers, sensitivities, scenario assumptions, hiring/opex envelopes, and decision log.
  - Pricing/monetization review: options with modeled impacts, risks, and rollout tests.

### People ops, talent, and L&D partners
- Why Cabal fits: Structures competency models, role architectures, hiring plans, and training kits with clarity on decisions and rationale.
- Mission patterns:
  - Role architecture refresh: leveling guide, competencies, interview plan, and scorecards.
  - Onboarding/L&D program: tracks, modules, assessments, and success metrics for a persona.
  - Org design/HC plan: scenarios for team shapes, hiring phasing, and risk/mitigation notes.

### Supply chain & operations resilience teams
- Why Cabal fits: Coordinates multi-node risk analysis, contingency options, and communication plans with audit trails.
- Mission patterns:
  - Disruption playbook for a key supplier/route: risk map, alt-sourcing options, cost/time impacts, and activation triggers.
  - Inventory strategy brief: target buffers, safety stock scenarios, working capital trade-offs, and KPI guardrails.
  - Logistics incident response: timeline, root causes, mitigation, comms to customers, and prevention plan.

### Data governance & AI safety boards
- Why Cabal fits: Captures model/data risks, policies, and mitigations with traceable approvals and testing plans.
- Mission patterns:
  - AI feature risk assessment: model/data inventory, risk vectors (privacy, bias, safety), mitigations, and red/amber/green call.
  - Data retention/usage policy update: obligations, edge cases, rollout plan, and training notes.
  - Evaluation plan for a model: metrics, adversarial tests, abuse cases, and reporting cadence.

### Public affairs & government relations teams
- Why Cabal fits: Structures stakeholder maps, positions, and engagement plans with scenario-based messaging and risk tracking.
- Mission patterns:
  - Legislative landscape brief: stakeholders, positions, likely moves, and response options.
  - Hearing/testimony packet: narrative, Q&A prep, evidence stack, and redlines for risky claims.
  - Stakeholder engagement plan: objectives, coalition options, message frames, and timeline.

## Notes
- Cabal is strongest on structured, multi-section text outputs with options, decisions, and rationale; not for code execution.
- Missions land best when they expect iteration: plan → review → refinement, with the Watchdog enforcing structure.
