# Cabal-Friendly Teams & Missions — TLDR (V3)

**TLDR:** Cabal works best for teams needing structured, auditable plans/briefs: strategy, research, GTM, technical, agencies, security/incident, compliance, customer success/support—plus finance/FP&A, people ops & L&D, supply chain/resilience, data governance/AI safety, and public affairs/government relations.

**ELI5:** Cabal is a smart writing room of specialists. It helps leaders, researchers, marketers, engineers, agencies, security/compliance, support teams—and now finance planners, HR/trainers, ops/logistics crews, AI safety/data stewards, and policy lobbyists—make clear plans with options and reasons.
