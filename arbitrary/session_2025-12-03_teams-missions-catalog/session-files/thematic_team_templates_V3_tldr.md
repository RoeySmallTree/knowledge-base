# Thematic Teams & Missions — TLDR (V3)

**TLDR:** Nine prebuilt Cabal teams now: legal adversarial squad; MIT-style research cell; public-equities analyst pod; startup strike team; crisis comms war room; customer success/support factory; plus new finance/FP&A board-pack crew, talent/L&D playbook studio, supply-chain resilience task force, and data governance/AI safety review board.

**ELI5:** We expanded the ready-made AI teams: courtroom debaters, lab researchers, stock detectives, startup builders, crisis PR responders, support playbook writers, finance planners for board decks, HR trainers, logistics fixers, and AI safety rule-checkers—all with clear roles, standards, and outputs.
