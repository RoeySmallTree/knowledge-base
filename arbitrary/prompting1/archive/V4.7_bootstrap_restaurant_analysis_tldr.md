# V4.7 Bootstrap Restaurant Analysis - TLDR

## TLDR

V4.7 Bootstrap prompt scored **88/100** against V1 principles — a 6-point improvement over the previous fitness app test. Excellent performance on:
- **Metric specificity** (98%) — Nearly every objective has a number
- **Persona intensity** (100%) — Uses all recommended intensity markers
- **Boundary respect** (100%) — Correctly does NOT create products

Minor gaps: Could be more explicit about which Decision Products will be needed in Plan & Assign.

**Verdict:** Production-ready. The prompt reliably produces output that would successfully initialize a CABAL session.

## ELI5

Imagine you're the captain of a team building something. Before you start, you need to:
1. Understand what the customer REALLY wants (not just what they said)
2. Set clear goals with numbers (not "make it good" but "get 50 customers in 6 months")
3. Give each team member a specific job and make them feel excited about it

The V4.7 prompt does all three really well. When we asked it to help build a restaurant menu app:
- It turned a simple request into an ambitious vision ("MenuMaster")
- It gave specific targets ($50K budget, 15% revenue increase, 99.9% uptime)
- It created exciting "personas" for each team member ("You are the restaurant whisperer...")

It also knew what NOT to do — it didn't start building the actual product (that's someone else's job later).

**Score: A-** (88/100)
