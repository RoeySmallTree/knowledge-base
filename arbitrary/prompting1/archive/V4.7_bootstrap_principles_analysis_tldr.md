# V4.7 Bootstrap Principles Analysis - TLDR

## TLDR

V4.7 Bootstrap prompt scores **82/100** against V1 principles. Excellent at persona intensity, metric specificity, and boundary respect. Gaps in explicit decision product planning and role acknowledgment.

## ELI5

The V4.7 prompts told Claude to act as a "mission architect" for a fitness app. Claude did great:
- Created exciting team personas ("Every millisecond of latency is a personal insult")
- Set specific goals (30-second time-to-first-workout, 80% recommendation follow rate)
- Didn't do things it shouldn't (no task assignments, no products created)
- Asked smart questions about what's missing

What could be better:
- Should explicitly say "we need to decide X before building Y"
- Team members could acknowledge each other's roles
- Reasoning could be more detailed

**Bottom line:** This prompt produces quality output that would start a CABAL session well.
