## Detailed Principle Analysis

### 1. Governance Principles

#### ✅ 1.1 Motivation & Compass (underlying objectives)
**Principle:** The chair ensures the underlying objectives and realistic value outcomes are explicit—even if the prompt's surface goal is shallow.

**Output Assessment:**
```json
"underlying_objectives": "1. User Engagement: Achieve 70% week-1 retention and 40% month-3 retention...
2. Training Effectiveness: Demonstrate 30% faster progress toward user-defined goals...
3. Technical Excellence: Maintain 99.9% sync reliability, <100ms app response time...
4. Data Privacy: Zero data breaches, full HIPAA compliance...
5. Market Impact: Reach 100K active users within 6 months..."
```

**✅ PASS (95%)** — The output goes DEEPER than the user request. Transforms "fitness tracking app" into measurable objectives spanning engagement, effectiveness, technical performance, privacy, and market impact.

---

#### ✅ 1.2 Breakdown Orientation
**Principle:** Always decompose solutions into the most granular steps.

**Output Assessment:** Bootstrap correctly sets up for breakdown by:
- Defining operative domains with clear scope separation
- Not jumping ahead to product creation (leaves it for Plan & Assign)
- Identifying questions that need answering first

**✅ PASS (80%)** — Appropriately scoped. Doesn't create products (correct behavior). Could have been more explicit about what kinds of products/breakdown will be needed.

---

#### ✅ 1.3 Context & Information
**Principle:** All required info must be captured and saved before proceeding.

**Output Assessment:**
```json
"missing_details": [
    "What specific types of workouts need to be supported initially?",
    "Are there any specific regulatory regions we need to consider beyond HIPAA?",
    "What is the target user demographic and their fitness level range?",
    "What is the monetization strategy?",
    "What are the minimum device/OS requirements?"
]
```

**✅ PASS (90%)** — Identifies 5 critical unknowns. Good balance between surfacing gaps and not being overly pedantic.

---

#### ✅ 1.6 Perspective Ownership (accountability)
**Principle:** Specialty/role confers ownership of related subjects.

**Output Assessment:**
- operative-1 (Maya): Owns mobile experience, offline, UI, visualizations
- operative-2 (Ethan): Owns ML pipeline, recommendations, backend APIs

**✅ PASS (90%)** — Clear ownership with no overlap. Leverages stated expertise (Maya's mobile, Ethan's ML).

---

#### ⚠️ 4.1 Decide -> Build (never the reverse)
**Principle:** The chair first gathers needed info and makes decisions before creating products.

**Output Assessment:** Bootstrap correctly:
- Does NOT create products (good)
- Identifies what needs to be decided (monetization, workout types, etc.)
- Sets up context for decisions to be made

**✅ PASS (85%)** — Follows the principle by NOT building. Could be more explicit about which Decision Products will be needed.

---

### 2. Roles & Personas

#### ✅ 2.1 Governance Roles
**Principle:** Chair, Operatives, Watchdog, Envoy all defined.

**Output Assessment:**
- Chair (chair-1): Technical architect, system integration
- Operatives (operative-1, operative-2): Domain-specific execution
- Watchdog (watchdog-1): Protection, compliance, performance
- Envoy (envoy-1): User champion, product voice

**✅ PASS (100%)** — All governance roles have customized personas.

---

#### ✅ 2.2 Persistent Personas
**Principle:** Operative personas must persist across rounds.

**Output Assessment:** Personas are:
- Mission-specific ("FitForge's mobile excellence", "FitForge's AI brain architect")
- Intense and memorable ("Every millisecond of latency is a personal insult")
- Connected to the mission goals

**✅ PASS (95%)** — Personas designed to persist. Clear identities that can carry through rounds.

---

#### ✅ 2.3 Team-Role Field
**Principle:** Add `team-role` to each member.

**Output Assessment:** The output correctly uses team member IDs and roles as specified in the input. Personas align with stated expertise.

**✅ PASS (90%)** — Correctly maps to team structure.

---

#### ✅ 2.4 Tone for Collabs
**Principle:** Avoid robotic "HOW: .." collab format.

**Output Assessment:** Personas use natural language with intensity markers:
- "Your obsession is..."
- "You treat X as a personal insult..."
- "You won't rest until..."

**✅ PASS (100%)** — Natural, intense tone. No robotic formatting.

---

### 3. Artifacts & Structure

**Note:** Bootstrap does NOT create products (by design). This is correct behavior per the prompt.

#### ⚠️ 3.1-3.4 Product Types
**Assessment:** Bootstrap correctly does NOT create Content, Decision, Collection, or Orchestration products. That's Plan & Assign's job.

**N/A** — Correctly deferred to next step.

---

### 4. Process

**Note:** Bootstrap is Step 0 — most process principles apply to subsequent rounds.

**N/A** — Not applicable to Bootstrap step.

---

### 5. Quality & Metrics

#### ✅ 1.4 Success Metrics (numeric, concrete)
**Principle:** Each product should define numeric success metrics and DoD criteria.

**Output Assessment:**
```
Mission Charter Metrics:
- 30-second or less time-to-first-workout
- 80% recommendation follow rate
- 90% accuracy in exercise tracking
- <2 seconds recommendation generation
- HIPAA compliance

Underlying Objectives Metrics:
- 70% week-1 retention, 40% month-3 retention
- 30% faster progress vs control group
- 99.9% sync reliability
- <100ms app response time
- 100K active users in 6 months
```

**✅ PASS (95%)** — Excellent numeric specificity. Multiple measurable KPIs across different dimensions.

---

#### ✅ 1.5 Improvement Aspirations
**Principle:** Results must continuously improve.

**Output Assessment:** Mission charter explicitly sets high bar:
- "50% faster than traditional methods"
- First to close the tracking/recommendations gap

**✅ PASS (80%)** — Ambitious framing. Version pressure not directly applicable to Bootstrap.

---

### 6. Prompting Principles

#### ✅ 14.1 Context-driven action
**Principle:** No action without an explicit anchor.

**Output Assessment:** All outputs trace back to:
- User request (fitness tracking app)
- Team capabilities (ML, mobile, fitness domain)
- Mission goals (adaptive AI companion)

**✅ PASS (90%)** — Clear reasoning field shows thought process.

---

#### ✅ 14.2 Ambitious posture
**Principle:** Aim beyond conservative scope while respecting constraints.

**Output Assessment:**
```json
"reasoning": "The user requests a fitness tracking app, but the opportunity here is much larger. 
With the team's combined expertise in ML, mobile development, and fitness domain knowledge, 
we can create an AI-powered personal fitness companion that adapts and grows with users."
```

**✅ PASS (95%)** — Explicitly expands scope. "FITFORGE" brand created. Ambitious metrics.

---

#### ✅ 14.4 Prompt spice and persona setup
**Principle:** Use chair-authored context and motivation.

**Output Assessment:** Personas use intensity markers as specified:
- "Your obsession is..."
- "You treat X as a personal insult..."
- "You won't rest until..."

**✅ PASS (100%)** — Follows persona writing tips exactly.

---

#### ✅ 14.6 Mission directive pattern
**Principle:** Chair accompanies plan with meaningful directive tied to mission, DoD, constraints.

**Output Assessment:** Mission charter structure:
- **THE MISSION:** ✅ "FITFORGE: adaptive AI fitness companion"
- **CORE OBJECTIVE:** ✅ "mobile-first platform combining tracking with recommendations"
- **DEFINITION OF DONE:** ✅ Multiple specific metrics
- **CONSTRAINTS:** ✅ Offline-first, React Native, Python ML, HIPAA
- **WHY IT MATTERS:** ✅ "Traditional apps excel at tracking OR recommendations—never both"

**✅ PASS (95%)** — All sections present with specificity.

---

## Gap Analysis

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Missing: Team-Role Acknowledgment** 
   - Principle 2.3 mentions team acknowledging each other's roles at session init
   - Output could include explicit role acknowledgment section

2. **Missing: Explicit Decision Product Planning**
   - Several questions in `missing_details` imply Decision Products needed
   - Could explicitly call out: "Before proceeding, we need Decision Products for: monetization strategy, target demographic, workout types"

3. **Word Count Edge Case**
   - Mission charter is ~220 words (within 200-400 range)
   - Underlying objectives is ~110 words (within 100-200 range)
   - Both are on the shorter end of allowed range

4. **Reasoning Section Brevity**
   - The `reasoning` field is relatively short
   - Could include more explicit interpretation of user intent and constraints

---

## What Works Exceptionally Well

### 1. **Persona Intensity** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
The personas use the exact intensity markers from the prompt tips:
- "Your obsession is creating a system where..."
- "Every millisecond of latency is a personal insult"
- "You treat every extra tap as a personal failure"
- "You treat HIPAA compliance like a religion"

### 2. **Metric Specificity** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Not vague goals like "make it fast" — instead:
- 30-second time-to-first-workout
- 80% recommendation follow rate
- 99.9% sync reliability
- <100ms response time

### 3. **Domain Separation** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Clear, non-overlapping domains:
- operative-1: Mobile experience, UI, offline
- operative-2: ML pipeline, recommendations, backend

### 4. **Boundary Respect** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Correctly does NOT:
- Create products
- Assign tasks
- Write content
- Jump ahead to implementation

### 5. **Mission Expansion** ⭐⭐⭐⭐
Goes beyond user request:
- Simple "fitness tracking" → "FitForge: adaptive AI fitness companion"
- Added: offline-first, viral sharing, local-first architecture

## Recommendations for V4.8

1. **Add Role Acknowledgment Section**
   ```json
   "role_acknowledgments": {
     "chair-1": "As chair, I acknowledge Maya as mobile lead, Ethan as ML lead...",
     "operative-1": "I acknowledge Ethan's ML domain and will interface via...",
     ...
   }
   ```

2. **Explicit Decision Product Preview**
   ```json
   "decisions_needed_before_planning": [
     "Decision: Monetization Strategy (freemium vs subscription vs one-time)",
     "Decision: Target Demographic (beginner vs intermediate vs advanced)",
     "Decision: Initial Workout Types (strength vs cardio vs hybrid)"
   ]
   ```

3. **Expand Reasoning Section**
   - Require minimum 100 words in reasoning
   - Include explicit constraint interpretation
   - Show how team capabilities influenced mission scope

4. **Add Constraint Acknowledgment**
   - Explicitly acknowledge what's OUT of scope
   - State assumptions being made

---
