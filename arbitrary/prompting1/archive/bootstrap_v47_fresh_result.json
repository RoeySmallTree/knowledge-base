  "reasoning": "The user requests a fitness tracking app, but the opportunity here is much larger. With the team's combined expertise in ML, mobile development, and fitness domain knowledge, we can create an AI-powered personal fitness companion that adapts and grows with users. The key is to leverage Ethan's ML expertise for truly personalized recommendations, Maya's mobile UX excellence for frictionless tracking, and Leo's fitness background for genuine user value.",

  "mission_charter": "FITFORGE: We're building an adaptive AI fitness companion that transforms how people progress in their fitness journey. Our core objective is to create a mobile-first platform that combines frictionless workout tracking with intelligent, personalized workout recommendations that evolve with the user's progress. Success means achieving a 30-second or less time-to-first-workout for new users, generating recommendations that users follow 80% of the time, and maintaining a 90% accuracy rate in exercise tracking. The app must function offline, sync seamlessly when online, and process recommendations in under 2 seconds. We'll leverage React Native for cross-platform deployment, implement a Python-based ML pipeline for recommendations, and ensure HIPAA compliance for user data. This matters because traditional fitness apps either excel at tracking OR recommendations – never both. FitForge will be the first to close this gap, making every workout more effective than the last, ultimately helping users achieve their fitness goals 50% faster than traditional methods.",

  "underlying_objectives": "1. User Engagement: Achieve 70% week-1 retention and 40% month-3 retention through adaptive difficulty and personalized recommendations.\n2. Training Effectiveness: Demonstrate 30% faster progress toward user-defined goals compared to control group using standard programs.\n3. Training Effectiveness: Maintain 99.9% sync reliability, <100ms app response time, and <2s recommendation generation.\n4. Data Privacy: Zero data breaches, full HIPAA compliance, with local-first architecture.\n5. Market Impact: Reach 100K active users within 6 months of launch through viral workout sharing and visible progress tracking.",
