Mission Alignment Check:\n- We need to establish core components for the TODO list MVP\n- Key areas needed: architecture design, frontend, backend, and testing infrastructure\n- Focus on meeting performance and reliability objectives\n\n2-3. Structure Decisions:\nWe need to create a logical structure under the MVP orchestration product to cover all mission aspects.\n\nLet me create the structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"structureDelta\": \"\n[Orchestration] TODO List MVP\n  [Decision] System Architecture Design\n  [Collection] Frontend Implementation\n    [Content] Core UI Components\n    [Content] State Management\n    [Content] Frontend Tests\n  [Collection] Backend Implementation\n    [Content] Database Schema\n    [Content] API Endpoints\n    [Content] Backend Tests\n  [Content] Integration Tests & Documentation\n\",\n  \"changes\": [\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"adc982b9-f52b-431d-bfe8-7cd374e30a29\",\n      \"addSubProducts\": [\n        {\n          \"name\": \"System Architecture Design\",\n          \"type\": \"Decision\",\n          \"definition_of_done\": \"Complete architecture diagram with tech stack decisions, data flow, and component structure\",\n          \"parentId\": \"adc982b9-f52b-431d-bfe8-7cd374e30a29\",\n          \"tempAssignmentId\": \"temp:1\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Frontend Implementation\",\n          \"type\": \"Collection\",\n          \"definition_of_done\": \"All frontend components implemented, tested, and integrated\",\n          \"parentId\": \"adc982b9-f52b-431d-bfe8-7cd374e30a29\",\n          \"tempAssignmentId\": \"temp:2\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Backend Implementation\",\n          \"type\": \"Collection\",\n          \"definition_of_done\": \"All backend services implemented, tested, and deployed\",\n          \"parentId\": \"adc982b9-f52b-431d-bfe8-7cd374e30a29\",\n          \"tempAssignmentId\": \"temp:3\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Core UI Components\",\n          \"type\": \"Content\",\n          \"definition_of_done\": \"Responsive React components with TypeScript\",\n          \"parentId\": \"temp:2\",\n          \"tempAssignmentId\": \"temp:4\"\n        },\n        {\n          \"name\": \"Database Schema\",\n          \"type\": \"Content\",\n          \"definition_of_done\": \"Complete PostgreSQL schema with migrations\",\n          \"parentId\": \"temp:3\",\n          \"tempAssignmentId\": \"temp:5\"\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"assignments\": [\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"temp:1\",\n      \"assigneeIds\": [\"operative-2\"],\n      \"directive\": {\n        \"importance\": 10,\n        \"comment\": \"**CORE OBJECTIVE:** Create a comprehensive system architecture design for the TODO list application.\\n\\n**DEFINITION OF DONE:**\\n- Complete architecture diagram showing all system components\\n- Technology stack decisions with justifications\\n- Data flow patterns and API contract\\n- Performance optimization strategies\\n- Security considerations\\n\\n**WHY IT MATTERS:** This design will be the foundation for all implementation work and ensure we meet our performance requirements.\\n\\n**CONTEXT:** Initial architecture design needed to start implementation work.\"\n      },\n      \"setRoundFocus\": true\n    },\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"temp:4\",\n      \"assigneeIds\": [\"operative-1\"],\n      \"directive\": {\n        \"importance\": 8,\n        \"comment\": \"**CORE OBJECTIVE:** Implement core UI components for the TODO list application.\\n\\n**DEFINITION OF DONE:**\\n- Task list component with add/edit/delete capabilities\\n- Responsive design working on both desktop and mobile\\n- TypeScript types for all components\\n- Unit tests with >80% coverage\\n- Sub-500ms render time\\n\\n**WHY IT MATTERS:** These components will form the primary user interface and determine the app's usability.\\n\\n**CONTEXT:** Parallelize frontend work while architecture is being designed.\"\n      },\n      \"setRoundFocus\": false\n    }\n  ],\n  \"acceptance\": [],\n  \"questionsForUser\": []\n}\n```\n\nRationale for decisions:\n\n1. Created a logical hierarchy with clear separation of concerns\n2. Started with two critical parallel tracks:\n   - System Architecture Design (Jordan) - Highest priority to guide all other work\n   - Core UI Components (Alex) - Can start in parallel with basic components\n\n3. Key Assignments:\n   - Assigned Jordan (operative-2) to architecture design as the Technical Specialist\n   - Assigned Alex (operative-1) to UI components leveraging frontend expertise\n   \n4. Round Focus:\n   - Set architecture design as round focus since it's critical path\n   - UI components can progress in parallel but depend on architecture decisions\n\n5. First Round Strategy:\n   - Focus on foundational elements\n   - Enable parallel work streams\n   - Ensure clear dependencies and deliverables\n\nThe structure and assignments ensure we're addressing all mission objectives while maintaining a clear path to the MVP. I've purposely kept the first round focused to avoid overloading the team and to ensure quality delivery of critical components.","refusal":null,"reasoning":null}}],"usage":{"prompt_tokens":1889,"completion_tokens":1277,"total_tokens":3166,"cost":0.049644,"is_byok":false,"prompt_tokens_details":{"cached_tokens":0,"audio_tokens":0,"video_tokens":0},"cost_details":{"upstream_inference_cost":null,"upstream_inference_prompt_cost":0.011334,"upstream_inference_completions_cost":0.03831},"completion_tokens_details":{"reasoning_tokens":0,"image_tokens":0}}}
