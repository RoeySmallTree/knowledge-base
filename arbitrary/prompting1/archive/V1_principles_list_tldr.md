# TLDR: CABAL Algorithm Principles List

**Artifact:** `V1_principles_list.md`
**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-04

## TLDR
This document consolidates all CABAL algorithm principles from the `algorithm/principles` directory into a single reference file. It covers:
1.  **Governance:** Scope, core principles, decision making.
2.  **Roles:** Chair, Operatives, Watchdog, Envoy, and personas.
3.  **Artifacts:** Product model (Content, Decision, Collection, Orchestration) and structure.
4.  **Process:** Operating cycle, collaboration, reflection, presentation.
5.  **Quality:** Success metrics, improvement pressure, compliance checklists.
6.  **Prompting:** Ethos, context discipline, mission briefs.

## ELI5
We made a "Master Rulebook" that lists every single rule for how the AI team works.
It explains:
-   Who does what (Roles).
-   How they make decisions (Governance).
-   What they build (Artifacts).
-   How they work together (Process).
-   How we know if it's good (Quality).
-   How to talk to them (Prompting).

It's a copy-paste of all the important rules in one place so we don't have to look at 7 different files.
