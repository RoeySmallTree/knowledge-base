# Changelog: Bootstrap Restaurant Analysis

## V2 — 2025-12-11

**What user requested:**
Add operational notes section covering:
1. Branding (product name) should be decided via Decision Product, not embedded in mission charter
2. Assumptions/settings (timeline, budget, uptime, revenue targets) should have artifact ownership

**What was changed:**
1. Added new **Operational Notes** section with three issues:
   - Issue 1: Branding Embedded in Mission Charter
   - Issue 2: Assumptions Stated Without Artifact Ownership
   - Issue 3: Metrics Without Ownership Chain

2. Added **Principle Violations Summary** table

3. Revised assessments for:
   - Principle 1.3 (Context & Information): 95% → 80%
   - Principle 4.1 (Decide → Build): 90% → 75%
   - Principle 3.6 (Selection Guide): 80% → 65%

4. Updated **Recommendations for V4.8** with three priority tiers:
   - Priority 1: Decision Flow Compliance (brand names, assumptions, constraints)
   - Priority 2: Artifact Planning (decision preview, metric ownership)
   - Priority 3: Structure Improvements (reasoning length, role mapping)

5. Adjusted overall score: 88/100 → 84/100

**Rationale:**
The original analysis correctly identified strong persona/metric quality but missed structural issues around decision flow. Branding decisions and setting assumptions should flow through proper Decision Products rather than being embedded in the mission charter.
