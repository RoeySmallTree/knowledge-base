Mission Alignment Check\nThe current product tree is misaligned - we have a \"TODO List MVP\" when we're building MenuMaster. We need to restructure around restaurant menu management with real-time inventory sync.\n\n## 2. Iteration vs Creation  \nThe Database Schema is ready for acceptance with no blocking collabs. The Technical Architecture Spec needs iteration to address Marcus's security concerns and missing auth section.\n\n## 3. Structural Decisions\nMajor restructure needed - replace TODO List MVP with MenuMaster MVP structure covering core restaurant functionality.\n\n## 4. Acceptance Decisions\nAccept Database Schema - it meets DoD and has no blockers.\n\n## 5. Assignments\nAlex needs to address the security vulnerabilities immediately. Jordan's request for POS Integration Priority decision is valid and needed.\n\n## 6. Questions for User\nNone - the mission and objectives are clear.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"structureDelta\": \"Remove Orchestration: \\\"TODO List MVP\\\"\\nAdd Orchestration: \\\"MenuMaster MVP\\\" [operative-1]\\n  > Collection: \\\"Core Platform\\\" [operative-1]\\n  > Collection: \\\"Restaurant Onboarding\\\" [operative-2]\\n  > Collection: \\\"Go-to-Market\\\" [operative-3]\\n  > Decision: \\\"POS Integration Priority\\\" [operative-2]\",\n\n  \"changes\": [\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"ade4951f-24d0-4218-b0fb-98f9fd057268\",\n      \"details\": {\n        \"definition_of_done\": \"All technical foundation products complete and security-validated\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"adc982b9-f52b-431d-bfe8-7cd374e30a29\",\n      \"remove\": true\n    }\n  ],\n\n  \"assignments\": [\n    {\n      \"productId\": \"d5d4ae24-3375-48c0-9b41-a4c90fe10fc9\",\n      \"assigneeIds\": [\"operative-1\"],\n      \"directive\": {\n        \"importance\": \"9\",\n        \"comment\": \"**CORE OBJECTIVE:** Fix critical security vulnerabilities and complete missing auth section in Technical Architecture Spec.\\n\\n**DEFINITION OF DONE:**\\n- Rate limiting added to /public/menus/:id endpoint\\n- Complete authentication/authorization section\\n- System diagram includes security boundaries\\n- All Marcus's security concerns addressed\\n\\n**WHY IT MATTERS:** Security vulnerabilities block production deployment and put customer data at risk.\\n\\n**CONTEXT:** Addressing Marcus's open collabs #8 (DDoS vulnerability) and #6 (missing auth section).
