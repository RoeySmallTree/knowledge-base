  "reasoning": "The user wants a SaaS for restaurant menu management, but this is a crowded space with many existing solutions. To create something truly valuable, we need to go beyond basic menu CRUD operations. The real opportunity lies in solving the complex ecosystem challenges restaurants face: multi-platform publishing, real-time inventory integration, dynamic pricing, compliance requirements, and operational efficiency. With Jordan's restaurant background, we have insider knowledge to build something that actually solves real pain points rather than just digitizing paper menus.",

  "mission_charter": "THE MISSION: Build MenuMaster, a comprehensive SaaS platform that transforms how restaurants manage, optimize, and distribute their menus across all digital touchpoints. CORE OBJECTIVE: Create an intelligent menu management system that goes beyond static listings to provide dynamic pricing, real-time inventory sync, multi-platform publishing, and actionable analytics that directly impact restaurant profitability. DEFINITION OF DONE: A fully functional MVP with 50+ restaurants actively using the platform, demonstrating measurable improvements in order accuracy (95%+), menu update speed (real-time), and revenue optimization (10%+ average increase through dynamic pricing). The platform must support integration with major POS systems, delivery platforms, and website builders. CONSTRAINTS: Target launch within 6 months, focus on independent restaurants and small chains (2-10 locations), prioritize ease of use over enterprise features. WHY IT MATTERS: Restaurants lose thousands annually from outdated menus, pricing errors, and manual processes. Our solution will save restaurant owners 10+ hours per week while increasing revenue through intelligent optimization and seamless operations.",

  "underlying_objectives": "Real-world impact centers on solving the operational chaos that plagues restaurant menu management. Success means restaurants can update prices instantly across all platforms when ingredients spike, automatically hide sold-out items to prevent disappointed customers, and use data-driven insights to optimize their offerings. Measurable success criteria: (1) 95%+ reduction in menu inconsistencies across platforms, (2) 10%+ average revenue increase through dynamic pricing and inventory optimization, (3) 80%+ reduction in time spent on menu updates, (4) 50+ paying customers within 6 months, (5) 4.5+ star average user satisfaction rating. The deeper value is transforming menu management from a reactive chore into a proactive profit center.",
