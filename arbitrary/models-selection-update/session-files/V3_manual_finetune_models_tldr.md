# Manual Model Fine-Tuning (TLDR)

TLDR: Manually upgraded Roast Pit, Shadow Council, and What-If Room outliers to better-fit models (creative/social for roasts, structured writers for dossier/textbook, stronger reasoning for execution).

ELI5: I swapped a few people to better helpers that match what they do.
