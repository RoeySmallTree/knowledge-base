# Manual Model Fine-Tuning

## Updates Applied
- The Roast Pit:
  - Singe → #151 (alt #136)
  - Vicious → #191 (alt #213)
  - Byte → #138 (alt #141)
  - Frost → #65 (alt #63)
  - Razor → #191 (alt #151)
  - Counsel → #66 (alt #55)
- The Shadow Council:
  - Cipher → #136 (alt #65)
  - Grix → #60 (alt #63)
- The What-If Room:
  - Codex → #136 (alt #65)

## Rationale Highlights
- Roast Pit roles are comedy-first; prioritized high-creativity, permissive, or social-intel models while keeping one host-tier premium.
- Cipher/Codex are formal dossier/textbook compilers; prioritized structured, high-quality writing models.
- Grix is a critical practical/execution role; upgraded to o3 Pro for stronger reasoning.
