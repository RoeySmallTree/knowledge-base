- **Request:** Add members missing from complete.json using DB records and model alignment rules.
- **Changes:** Inserted missing members from members-ids.json into complete.json; updated team IDs for Diss Track Inc. and The Intelligence Bureau to match DB.

## V2 (2026-02-02T00:00:00Z)
- **Request:** Manual fine-tune best models for remaining roles.
- **Changes:** Adjusted Roast Pit, Shadow Council, and What-If Room outliers to higher-fit models.
