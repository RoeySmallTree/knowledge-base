## Overview
Update LLM models overview with delete candidates from to-consume files.

## Tasks Completed
- Compiled model deletion candidates across to-consume files into overview.md.
- Added short reasons for each delete candidate in overview.md.
- Added kept-model lists with logical/creative/efficiency scores after delete list.
- Added personality and professional-traits lists per kept model, using source file fields.
- Added best-for lines per kept model, sourced from each model file.
- Added total and active parameter bullets per kept model (split where possible).
- Added short description lines per kept model, sourced from each model file.
- Rebuilt overview with delete + keep sections and matched ids from ids.md into kept models.
- Updated ID matching to prefer free variants; corrected Devstral Small 2 to N/A.
- Removed models with missing IDs from overview keep list per request.

## Key Decisions
