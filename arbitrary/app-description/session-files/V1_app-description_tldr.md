# TLDR
The app has a sticky top bar to switch between Models and Teams, a fixed left navigation guide (and a fixed right filters panel on Models), and a scrollable center area. Models are grouped by vendor/family, support drag reordering, show detailed cards, and allow editing/archiving plus nested fallback selection. Teams are grouped by category, sortable by drag, show team details with member rows, and members can be edited, deleted, and assigned models via the same nested picker.

# ELI5
It’s a control dashboard: the top bar switches between models and teams. The left side is a navigation tree, the right side (for models) is filters, and the middle is the main content. You can drag to reorder things, click edit to change details, and pick fallback or member models from a nested list.
